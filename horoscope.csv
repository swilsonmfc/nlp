aries,20210101,"Your bold action makes life a lot better, and not just for you! It's one of those days when you show the world what you're made of and it sits up to pay close attention! Take a risk."
aries,20210102,"Today is a fiery day all around, so make sure that you're making the most of this explosive energy. You should be able to show at least one person how to come out of their shell if you feel like it."
aries,20210103,"Try something healthy and fun today: a new kind of workout, a nutritious treat, or maybe even an online dance class. You need to take care of yourself, of course, but it doesn't have to be a drag."
aries,20210104,Someone needs help. Can you give them what they need? It's a good idea for you to step up and ensure that you're giving your all to the person in your life who can really use it.
aries,20210105,"You need to listen closely today. There's one person who really needs your input, but only once you've heard theirs. Try to keep your mouth shut for a while. It's good exercise, and it can really help!"
aries,20210106,"You can get what you want today, but you have to use your charm rather than your boldness. If you smile sweetly, you can get quite a lot more out of people than if you frown."
aries,20210107,Try to take greater care with your temper today. It's simply far too easy for you to shake people up when you think you're just venting. It might be hard for you to relate to certain people for now.
aries,20210108,"Something that starts small could really get under your skin today, so make sure that you're ready to discuss it or find a way to release the pressure once it starts to build. You can do this!"
aries,20210109,"You might say the wrong thing to the wrong person today, but that doesn't mean you're doomed! In fact, it could be just what's needed to break the ice. Don't feel bad!"
aries,20210110,It's a great time to meet new people. You are quite likely to run into someone from far away that you'd never have expected. It's a great time to round out your growing list of friends.
aries,20210111,"You need to take things down a notch today, though those around you could be speeding up! Just remember that you have to take things at the pace that feels most natural to you and keep on keeping on."
aries,20210112,"Try to find your emotional center today. It's probably with your keys or phone. When you feel grounded, you should be able to make some real progress with a loved one."
aries,20210113,"Don't despair. Things are good, and you can push through the latest wave of weirdness to make it out the other side. You should be able to show that one doubter what you're really made of!"
aries,20210114,"You are a true pioneer today, so act like it! Your great ideas and energy make you perfect for trying new activities and leading the way for the less adventurous. Almost everyone else, that is."
aries,20210115,"Your leadership abilities are unquestioned, but you may still find that it's easier for you to defer to others occasionally, if only to let them feel a sense of ownership over their lives."
aries,20210116,"It's one of those days when you just want to lie low. Try to take the day off, if you can, though you may find that harder than usual because your conscience pesters you to take care of business."
aries,20210117,"The more you help out, the more you get back. That could just mean taking an advisory position and assisting people with their own projects, or it could mean letting someone take charge temporarily."
aries,20210118,"You need to take part in something new and cool,and your energy ensures that you either choose or stumble upon the perfect activity! Share it with friends or keep it to yourself."
aries,20210119,"Your cultural leanings are making life more fun and engaging, so get out there and mix it up! You should find that you're at the cutting edge, at least among your friends."
aries,20210120,"You can tell that your hard work is finally coming to a fruitful end. It's one of those days when you feel tired, relaxed, and confident, so keep moving in the right direction and enjoy the results."
aries,20210121,"You could wrap yourself up in old memories or objects today, shopping online for antiques, poring over old photos, or just lost in reverie. It's a good time to just hang out and reminisce."
aries,20210122,An e-mail could bring some strange but welcome news today. You may find that you need to stick with electronic communication today if you want to get anything done.
aries,20210123,"Your phone keeps ringing, but you can't always answer it. Try to manage your communications with an eye toward what's more important to you. Make one person a priority and keep them available."
aries,20210124,You need to clarify a few things in your own mind before you can feel comfortable speaking out. It's a good time to think through the issues and see what's most important to you.
aries,20210125,"You need to release some pent-up emotions today. That could involve an argument, some vigorous exercise, or even a good, long cry. Whatever it is this time, give it your all!"
aries,20210126,"Your mind is on your home life today, so make sure that you're giving it whatever it deserves. You may decide that you need to pack up and take a step backward so you can get going again soon!"
aries,20210127,"You could be a demon in the kitchen today, mixing and matching and inventing all sorts of delights. It's a great time to experiment with food and see what new combinations you can devise."
aries,20210128,"Your brave heart is legendary, so take the time to choose your battles with care today. The right word or action at the right time, hard as it may be, can make life far better for everyone concerned."
aries,20210129,"Your sweeter, more romantic side is on display today, so make the most of it! You may find that your energy is perfect for new people or perhaps just that one special someone."
aries,20210130,"It's a day of routines for you and your people, but try not to grumble or look bored. It's a great time to get things done, and there's really only one way to do that effectively."
aries,20210131,"This isn't the right time to make lofty plans or race off in exciting new directions. You just have to take care of the boring, mundane tasks that occasionally take hold of your life."
aries,20210201,"You need to make sure that you're paying close attention to what others are doing and saying today, or you might find that you're totally lost when it comes times to make a decision."
aries,20210202,"Can you put off your own projects for one more day? Hope that you can, because all the karma you rack up today is sure to get used up in the days ahead. It's totally worth it to give unto others!"
aries,20210203,"You've got a lot more going on than you want to admit, and that could cause some problems with your people. Try not to get too bent out of shape over misunderstandings. They're par for the course."
aries,20210204,"Your emotional side is causing some friction today, but it's nothing too dramatic. You might have to cope with some stray baggage that you thought you'd checked long ago."
aries,20210205,"You are slowing down somewhat, but it's not permanent. Your energy is perfect for thinking about big issues and making sure that you're on the right path. Things are looking up!"
aries,20210206,"Your independent mind comes up with new ideas at great speed, but there's no need to share them just yet. Your energy is better spent on brainstorming and recording your best plans."
aries,20210207,"It's a good time to take action, even if that means you've got to wing it! Your good energy is perfect for leaving your mark on the world, whether you're at work or looking for love."
aries,20210208,"Your drive is legendary, and you may find that at least one person is counting on you to push them (and you) in the right direction. You're feeling self-confident enough to make it happen!"
aries,20210209,"Your eyes are wide open today, and you should find that your people are ready to back you up when you make your move. It's a good day to take advantage of new and surprising opportunities."
aries,20210210,Your goals are within reach if you just push yourself a little further! You should find that it's easier than ever to flow past obstacles. Stop yammering and start adapting. Things are getting better!
aries,20210211,"One of your deeply held ambitions comes closer to the surface today, and you're happy as can be about that. Things are looking up for you, so just believe in yourself and all should work out for the best."
aries,20210212,"Today poses a real problem for you, and it's one you can't ignore. There is good news, though: you can fix this, although it might take a few days away from your master plan to do so."
aries,20210213,"This is not a good time to take on new plans or projects, even a first date should be rescheduled if possible! You just need to focus on the past, and that's not conducive to novelty."
aries,20210214,"Try something, anything, because your energy is driving you to experience all that life has to offer. Your great spirit demands action, and you just can't let it down. Go for it!"
aries,20210215,"Your explorations are the stuff of legend, and today you need to make sure that your legend is heard far and wide. You may find that your people are more than willing to follow your lead."
aries,20210216,"You've got to handle a financial situation that isn't quite what you had hoped it would be. The good news is that your brain is perfect for this kind of work, so block out the time and make it happen."
aries,20210217,"It could be time for a closet purge. You've got too much stuff cluttering your life! In the unlikely event that your space isn't stuffed, you may need to do some targeted shopping to get back in balance."
aries,20210218,"You're not moving as quickly as you'd like, but there's more to life than speed. You may need to check in with your people for some assistance if you get too far behind, though."
aries,20210219,"Life is sweet today! You can make all kinds of progress toward work goals, personal milestones, or practically anything else without too much effort. It's all thanks to smooth talking and fun people."
aries,20210220,"Your ability to reach other people and make them understand where you're coming from is pretty amazing, but that doesn't mean you can't stumble. Pay attention to everything going on around you."
aries,20210221,"You've got deeply held emotional business bubbling up to the surface now. Things may get a little weird later in the day, but you still need to keep focused on what's most important to you."
aries,20210222,"Family needs are dominant today, so focus on kids, partner or the folks back home. Whatever you do, expect to get rewarded tenfold in the near future."
aries,20210223,"Your parents play a role in the day's activities, even if they're distant memories now. You're still one result of their lives, and your connection to your heritage is as strong as it's ever been."
aries,20210224,"Your creative energy is fully engaged with some new project, so make sure that you're pushing it as far as it can go. Things may start to look really good for you by day's end."
aries,20210225,"If you've got kids, today is all about them, even more so than usual. The good news is that your energy is in sync with little ones. If you don't have any, find a friend who does and offer to babysit."
aries,20210226,"You are dealing with one detail too many today, so do what you can to pass them off on others who can tackle them more effectively. The good news is that your allies can come to the rescue!"
aries,20210227,"The details could get frustrating today as you find people focusing too much on the small stuff and ignoring the big picture. Still, you've got to follow their lead even if it means you're neck deep in spreadsheets."
aries,20210228,"That little pain in your foot or digestive issue could start to flare up today, so pay careful attention and try not to make it worse. It's a good day to follow up with a health care professional."
aries,20210301,Just pay attention today. That mystery is sure to be resolved if you can just listen to what your partner or friend or customer is saying. Somewhere buried in the words is the germ of truth.
aries,20210302,"You can charm the birds from the trees if that's what you want, so make sure that you're pointing that smile in the right direction! It might be a good time for you to chat up that new hottie."
aries,20210303,You need to be more careful about any aggressive tendencies. Today could bring too many opportunities to start fights or intimidate the wrong people. Take a deep breath before starting anything.
aries,20210304,"You're feeling upset, and for good reason! People could be acting like jerks today, but there's not much you can do about it. Plotting revenge is for lesser mortals."
aries,20210305,"You may step on a few toes today, but there's nothing wrong with that this time. Those with sensitive feelings are out of place, whereas those who want to get things done are in their element."
aries,20210306,"You might meet someone new who changes the way you think about your life. Perhaps their cultural perspective is quite different from yours, or maybe they're just extremely persuasive!"
aries,20210307,"Slow down! You can't make as much progress as you'd like today, and that could mean serious frustration when things start to get weird. It's a good time for you to go over your plans."
aries,20210308,"Your emotional side needs some work today, so make sure that you're giving yourself the time and space you need to deal with whatever has been bugging you. It's easier than you think!"
aries,20210309,"Your ability to find the right path is unerring today, so get out there and blaze a trail! Your brainy energy helps you lead with confidence as you show people the way toward a brighter future."
aries,20210310,"Your natural leadership is a huge asset today, and the people around you can see that. It shouldn't be hard for you to get others to follow along, so act with confidence and make things happen."
aries,20210311,"Try to just chill out today as much as you can. You don't have the right kind of energy to exert your will on the world, but you can at least rest, heal, and get ready for the exciting times to come!"
aries,20210312,"It's a good day to help out around the office or home. You're better off assisting others than tackling your own projects. Things are just about to change, though, so don't get in too deep!"
aries,20210313,Something new pops up on your radar and forces you to take notice. You may find that you're in the middle of a new adventure before you even realize what led up to this exciting moment!
aries,20210314,This is the perfect time to take the next steps in a project that’s been stalled. You know that new idea you want to implement? Do it now! 
aries,20210315,"Your passion is fully engaged today, so make sure that you're showing your people as much love as you can. It could be your love life is all riled up, or maybe you've got a brand-new gig!"
aries,20210316,You should find that you reach a milestone today after quite a lot of hard work. Relax and enjoy the moment. It's not all that often that you get such concrete rewards. Spread them around!
aries,20210317,"Now is a good time to look through the attic for valuables. Your eye for antiques and collectibles is sharper than ever. Whether you're selling or buying, you should get the best value."
aries,20210318,You need to write out nearly everything today. It might feel like you're living on e-mail! It's a great time to communicate clearly and let colleagues know what's really going on.
aries,20210319,
aries,20210320,"Take greater care with your words than usual. You don't want to upset anyone by accident, though doing so intentionally may actually be the best possible course of action to take."
aries,20210321,Try not to keep a lid on your emotions today. You need to express yourself clearly even if that causes problems. They're the kind of problems that lead to solutions!
aries,20210322,"Find an outlet for your rage or frustration today. Otherwise, you're sure to let it out inappropriately, and who needs that? It's a good day to talk things over or to exercise your cares away."
aries,20210323,"You're feeling terrific today, so head out for an adventure! A friend might be up for something fun, but you can have a great time on your own too."
aries,20210324,Take bold action today. You know you've got it in you! You may find it easier to demand a raise from your boss or stand up to a bully.
aries,20210325,"Your fiery energy is ready for almost anything today, so get ready for some crazy antics! It's a good day for you to step up and take charge of a situation that has been going nowhere."
aries,20210326,"Try to do something healthy today, healthier than your usual routine, that is! Even if you're a workout-addicted vegan, you can still find a new way to make yourself even fitter."
aries,20210327,"You need to show someone how useful you can be, so volunteer to help out or show off your previous work. Things are looking good as long as you're focusing your energy outward."
aries,20210328,"Now is a good time for you to get started on new projects of all kinds, even those that seem daunting. Legal paperwork is easier to cut through for you, so seize the initiative."
aries,20210329,Blow off your own needs for one more day. You ought to rack up some more good karma before launching into anything new or unusual. One last friend needs your help in a big way.
aries,20210330,"Something major happens late in the day that could cause problems for you. The good news is that the issue should be extremely short-lived, so don't panic about the future."
aries,20210331,"You're slowing down today, but that's a good thing! Make sure that you're taking your time with whatever is coming your way, because getting it right is far more important than getting it done fast."
aries,20210401,"You're feeling the urge to explore, so throw away the map and take off in a bold new direction! This could be as simple as trying a new kind of food or as crazy as a spontaneous road trip."
aries,20210402,"You are leading the way again, though there's someone who's a little dubious about where you're headed. Ignore them! You believe in yourself, and for now that's all you really need."
aries,20210403,"You can make a real difference as long as you believe in yourself, so make sure that you're giving yourself the benefit of the doubt and marching forward toward your epic destiny!"
aries,20210404,"You're on the road to success, but you might not see results quite yet. Your drive is strong, so you should be able to soldier on despite whatever obstacles are in your path. Keep it up!"
aries,20210405,"You might feel like you're living in a science fiction movie today. Things are moving quickly, and you could be excited to see new possibilities open up before your eyes. Enjoy the future!"
aries,20210406,"You have to sit down and make plans today or you may find that things are too crazy to handle. Your energy is just right for at least one major distraction, but no more than that."
aries,20210407,"Reach out and lend a hand to someone who needs it today. You should score extra karma, and you may find that you're drawn toward something new and cool once the day is done."
aries,20210408,"Something could go down early in the day that turns into a real problem, so face it head-on and make sure that you've got everyone on your side. It's not as hard as you think."
aries,20210409,This is a fine time to end old projects but not so much for starting new ones. See if you can get your colleagues to ease up. You should have a pretty full plate for the time being.
aries,20210410,You should step up and use some of this amazing energy to take action. The world needs what you have! It's a really good day for some fun things that just need a little initiative.
aries,20210411,"Your natural curiosity is in overdrive right now, and you should find it easier than ever to dig up clues on your new favorite obsessions. Explore far beyond your usual haunts."
aries,20210412,You're in a terrific mood even if your energy level is somewhat low. Your affable nature helps you to make new friends and even get along even with people you usually don't care for.
aries,20210413,How are your finances? You need to step up and make sure that you're doing right by yourself when it comes to debt or cash flow. Things should get better soon if you work on it now.
aries,20210414,"You're feeling pretty feisty today, so much so that you could fire up a few arguments just to see where they lead! It's a good time for you to step up and make your case whenever the mood strikes you."
aries,20210415,"This isn't a good day for intense business, but you should at least try to get on with your regular tasks. In fact, you can get quite a lot done by focusing on the superficial."
aries,20210416,"Your playful side is out in force now, and you should find it easier than usual to get a date (if you're looking) or impress people with your easygoing nature. Show off a little!"
aries,20210417,"You may not feel at your best, but you can still get an amazing amount of work done today. Take pride in that even as your intense emotional state casts a shadow over the evening."
aries,20210418,You're making progress on some emotional business that has been troubling you lately. See if you can get your people to back off and give you the space you need to clear this all away.
aries,20210419,"You're feeling the heat, and you may find that your friends like it as much as you do! Your great energy is perfect for almost any activity, so light up the night and have a great time!"
aries,20210420,"Your impulsive nature is pushing you to make some crazy changes in your life, but they should be mostly positive in their effects! You are sure to run into someone from your past if you keep moving."
aries,20210421,You are the most important person in the room today. It's your energy that gets things rolling. Make sure that you're ready for action at a moment's notice because things could move really fast.
aries,20210422,"Slow down and let things go at their own pace. You need to deal with the world as it is, not how you wish it could be. If you can avoid any rush jobs, you should find that things go well for you."
aries,20210423,"This could be a slow time for you and yours, so do your best to keep everything moving along even if you don't have deadlines. Things should start to move more quickly in a few days."
aries,20210424,"Work that charm to get what you want today. You can't be denied! It's easier than ever for you to disarm those around you, so don't bother with brute force. Things just got a lot easier!"
aries,20210425,"Get started on something new even if it's just cleaning the house! You're feeling pulled in a new direction, and it should lead to opportunities if you keep moving in the right direction."
aries,20210426,"You are feeling hopeful, so get out there and volunteer or at least lift the spirits of someone close who's got the blues. The karma you earn is just the icing on the cake!"
aries,20210427,"You're stuck in an awkward situation, one that isn't likely to be resolved today. That doesn't mean you're in misery, just that you're likely to need some downtime to think things through when it's over."
aries,20210428,"You may not like how today works out for you, but there's some really important healing going on beneath the surface. Make sure that you're pushing back against your restlessness."
aries,20210429,"Your honesty is important today, so be as open as can be. Even one slipup can lead to troubles that end up biting you in the rear end. Speak from the heart!"
aries,20210430,"You might step on one toe too many today, but don't hold back! You need to speak your mind even if other people are overly sensitive. You've got plenty of time to apologize if need be!"
aries,20210501,"You are a little worried about how others see you. It's like high school all over again! Try not to freak out too much, because the best thing you can do is act as naturally as possible."
aries,20210502,"Take a rest today, if possible. Moving too quickly isn't recommended because you don't have all the information you need to do things right. You should find that life gets better soon."
aries,20210503,"You should get what you need today as long as you can ask for it. Things are looking good for you, and your intellectual energy is topped up and ready for a challenge."
aries,20210504,Something new and exciting comes your way and you'd have to be crazy not to follow it up! You can almost certainly find new opportunities to shake things up in exactly the right way at work or at home.
aries,20210505,"You've got to lend a hand to those in need today. At least one person is counting on you. Things may get pretty hectic later, but as long as you're focusing outward, all should be well."
aries,20210506,"A dream carries a powerful message, but can you remember it all? Even if you don't recall a thing, you should find that you're still being influenced in a deep way. Keep on moving!"
aries,20210507,Get started on something new and cool. It could be anything that revs your engine! Your amazing energy guarantees that you bring this new project to a thrilling conclusion.
aries,20210508,"Stay active as much as you can or you might not be sure that you're still alive! Your energy should lift your mood, but if you've got to spin your wheels much longer, it just can't last."
aries,20210509,You need to stick it out today or there's just no telling what might pop up tomorrow or the next day. Things are only going to work out for you if you believe in yourself.
aries,20210510,You can feel a bit better about your lack of progress when you realize that your values are still intact. It's a really good time for you to remind yourself of what is most important to you.
aries,20210511,"It's important that you be direct today or you're just wasting your time. You do have to be nice about it, but you should find that it's still worth standing your ground."
aries,20210512,"Try to avoid the tiny little details of life today. You're better off with the long view. If you can make plans and oversee big-picture activities, you are sure to be at your best."
aries,20210513,"Brevity is the soul of wit, so be as witty as you can be today! Keep all your communications short and to the point and you are sure to blow past any competition you may have."
aries,20210514,"You need to move closer to what you think of as home. That could just mean skipping work or school, or it could involve a long-term lifestyle change. Whatever it is, take it seriously!"
aries,20210515,It's all on you. Today's big project requires your initiative to push things through. You may find that it's easier to just start on your own and let others peek over your shoulder.
aries,20210516,"Your ability to get stuff done is propelling you forward today, and your people just have to try to catch up. Things are sure to move even more quickly by this time tomorrow, so rest up!"
aries,20210517,"You need to burn off some of this amazing energy, so get some exercise by any means necessary. Take the stairs, stretch at your desk, or walk around the block."
aries,20210518,"Your body needs some attention, so try yoga, aerobics, walking, or anything else that can help you to focus on your physical self. It's a really good time to try things that are a little different."
aries,20210519,"You need to do something positive for your health, and you are the best judge of what that is. Still, it might be a good idea to solicit advice from your healthiest friends and co-workers."
aries,20210520,You have to direct your attention outward today or things could get difficult. Your energy is best spent helping others instead of focusing on your personal needs.
aries,20210521,"Try not to get too crazy about that one little irritant. It's not the end of the world. In fact, if you spend too much time worrying about it, you are sure to miss out on a golden opportunity!"
aries,20210522,"Now is a great time to get started on new projects, especially those that require paperwork or other bureaucratic ephemera. Your ability to navigate such terrain is heightened now."
aries,20210523,"You easily resist the urge to go your own way or ignore those in need, but you may find that your own needs start to become harder to ignore by the end of the day. There's nothing wrong with that!"
aries,20210524,"You are feeling an urgent need for downtime, so make sure that you can get away by yourself for a while! It's easier than you think to deal with these feelings, but you need to take them seriously first."
aries,20210525,"You are going through some deep emotional issue, but it's sure to end up positive for you. Things are in motion that should end with you feeling more confident, mature, and ready for the next chapter."
aries,20210526,"Get out there and take in some culture. Your energy demands cultural exposure, and there's just no denying it this time. You might have to create your own event."
aries,20210527,"Your thinking can't be constrained by the group, so let yourself roam free! Your terrific mental energy should help you come up with at least four great new ideas to get started on right away."
aries,20210528,"You've got to stay as grounded as possible. Emotional trouble could arise if you get too crazy. Take deep breaths, get some exercise, or just have a long talk with someone who knows you really well."
aries,20210529,"If you believe in yourself, all things are possible, at least on a day like today. Self-confidence is your secret weapon, and you should find that things start to open up if you just assume the best."
aries,20210530,"You're struck by an inspiring vision of the future, so get to work bringing it to life! You should be able to get at least a few people to follow along if you tell them what's coming."
aries,20210531,"You're not sure exactly what you want, but you can tell that it's coming. Of course, you have to work hard to make it real, but that's never stopped you before. Move forward at least a little today."
aries,20210601,"You need to deal with something big and spooky and real, so get on with it! Your energy is a bit diffuse, but that actually makes it easier to handle this phase of your life."
aries,20210602,"This is not the best time to start off in new directions, so either slow down or make sure that you're putting off whatever plans you had made for today. Things should snap back into place tomorrow!"
aries,20210603,"Take action today! You should make sure that you find a way to use this terrific energy that is coursing through you. Even if you're not sure what you want, you still need to take action."

aries,20210606,"It's time to take inventory. Write down a list of everything you own that's of any importance, then get rid of the rest! It can be quite liberating to realize you don't need so much stuff."
aries,20210607,"Think of all the ways you can save time today and then file them away for some other day. You need to dawdle and move slowly for now, if only to let your big ideas percolate for a little longer."
aries,20210608,You should find it easy to get through today's chores or projects. Your energy is in sync with the universe. Make sure that you share your good fortune with your friends if you want even more.
aries,20210609,"Your people need to hear the word from you, so compose yourself and then let them know what's going on. Things should start to work a lot more smoothly once you're all on the same page."
aries,20210610,"Your emotional side is making short work of whatever situation you're facing today, so feel free to let fly! It may be hard to explain to others why you're huffing and puffing, but then again, you don't have to."
aries,20210611,It's family time! Reconnect with far-flung family members and see if you can either hold a reunion or share that special vibe that only comes from your closest people.
aries,20210612,"Your parents are affecting your activities today even if they're not really part of your life any more. You know they're still in your head, at least, so get comfy with them and see how it goes."
aries,20210613,"Your romantic side is on display, so ask that hottie out. You should be able to make an impression with ease!"
aries,20210614,"Your creative energy is undeniable today, so bust out with some new ideas or show your boss what you can do. It's easier than you think to change the way you live your life!"
aries,20210615,Try not to feel bad about going through the motions. It's one of those days when your routines are the best way to get through the slog. You may need to focus on the small stuff so you can have big adventures later.
aries,20210616,"Your basic responsibilities should be your highest priority today even if they bore you to tears. They're still important, and you've got plenty of motivation. The fun starts soon!"
aries,20210617,"Details are swimming before your eyes today, and you may have a hard time focusing on spreadsheets or anything else that's densely packed with information. Try to think big, if possible."
aries,20210618,"Try to look for good deeds to do today. You need to boost your karma a bit, and you should find that you're better off in the long run if you blow off your own needs for a bit."
aries,20210619,"Any problems you have today can be attributed to listening. Do what you can to hear out those closest to you, and try to make sure that you're being as clear as you can be."
aries,20210620,"Try to wrangle your deeper feelings up and out of your subconscious. It's hard work, but right now you've got some support from the universe, so it should be totally worthwhile."
aries,20210621,"Your emotional side is working like crazy on getting you over this weird situation, but you have to trust your heart. Follow its guidance and you can't go wrong no matter what happens."
aries,20210622,"The day moves at a glacial pace, and you may get bored or impatient as you try to figure out what to do next. It's a good day to just let the world do its own thing and focus on personal business."
aries,20210623,"Try to let your people come to their own conclusions just like you did! It's a great day for pushing ahead with your own plans, and your energy should help you move past obstacles with ease."

aries,20210625,"It's a great day to push for something new. Your drive for success is powerful! You may find it easier to work on your own, because most of your people are neck-deep in their own issues."
aries,20210626,"You need to seize a big opportunity or create one if you don't see anything likely to be a hit. It's one of those days when almost anything is possible, but you have to act to create change."

aries,20210628,"It's all about ambition today, so make sure that you're sharing your desires with those who can help you achieve them. Your mental energy is perfect for this kind of direct promotion."
aries,20210629,"Try not to take on any new projects today. You've got to do as little as possible, actually! It's one of those days when you're sure to end up moving backward if you try to do too much."
aries,20210630,"Your energy is meant to be shared today. In fact, you're better off helping others than trying to take care of your own business. See if you can get a friend to admit they need your help."
aries,20210701,Try something new and exciting today. Your energy is pushing you to new heights. It's a good time for you to explore new territory or to find new ways to do what you love. It's easy!
aries,20210702,"Your amazing personal energy is driving you to explore cultural issues and artifacts like art, music, ethics, and the like. You should discover at least one awesome new detail that changes your life."
aries,20210703,"Your hard work finally pays off, and this may be just the first installment. It's a good day for you to relax a bit as you prepare for the next phase of your big plan. Get back to it soon, though!"
aries,20210704,"Your interest in history is rekindled today -- maybe by an old object that has some special meaning to you, or maybe by a memory of something from your childhood. Follow it up all the way."
aries,20210705,"An email blows your mind today -- though the reason could be almost anything. A confession, a bit of good news, or even a crazy typo shakes you up and makes you think things through."
aries,20210706,"A phone call early today sets the tone for the rest of the day and into the night. It could be negative, but it's more likely to be quite positive -- you should know just before you hear the ring."
aries,20210707,"Communication is everything today -- so you need to choose your words with greater care. That may not come naturally to you, but that just means that you've got to slow down and take more time."
aries,20210708,"This is not the best time to suppress your initial reactions -- in fact, you may want to let fly with whatever crosses your mind. That does involve some backtracking, but better that than dishonesty."
aries,20210709,"You need an emotional outlet -- and that doesn't mean a punching bag! Unless boxing is your preferred means of venting, you need to find a non-aggressive method for handling all this."
aries,20210710,"You need to work out some of this great energy -- so go have an adventure! It may be at work or out in the wild, but your amazing vigor is a sight to behold. Others are quite impressed!"
aries,20210711,It's definitely time for bold action -- so step up and make sure that your people are really paying attention. Things should start to get really interesting sometime in the late afternoon.
aries,20210712,Your great energy is so powerful that it may almost feel like you're burning up. Don't panic -- just put it to use and you can make great things happen. You are the center of it all right now.
aries,20210713,"Try something healthy and new today -- maybe a long walk up a staircase, maybe a shot of wheatgrass juice or maybe just a long, quiet meditation session. Your energy will thank you later!"
aries,20210714,"Someone needs you today. It could be a friend or family member, a colleague or even a hungry kid at the other end of town. Make the most of what you've got!"
aries,20210715,"Your ability to tune in to other people's issues is strong now, so use it to figure out what your next move should be. It's more important than ever to take the whole social situation into account."
aries,20210716,"Your ability to charm the room is heightened, so it's a good time for public speaking or negotiating. Blunt force isn't a good idea, so make sure you're working the carrot more than the stick."
aries,20210717,"You need to be careful about aggression today -- both yours and in those around you! It's too easy to let minor disagreements turn into full-on raging brawls, and that's not helpful."
aries,20210718,"Your mood hits a low point, but you can't put your finger on why, exactly. It could be that you just need to walk away from today's big issues and let your heart slow down a bit before returning."
aries,20210719,"A minor setback feels like a big deal to you -- but it's mostly in your head. Try not to read too much into it this time and see what happens. You may still be grouchy, but at least you're not panicking!"
aries,20210720,"You're feeling quite good -- but maybe just a bit out of touch with your peers. That makes today perfect for focusing on personal projects, as you risk offending folks you work closely with."
aries,20210721,"You meet someone new -- and possibly new to your city. It's a good time to play tour guide, as your great energy is perfect for showing off your favorite spots and making folks feel welcome."
aries,20210722,You need to slow down a bit and try to just relax -- you're heading for a breakdown otherwise! Even the highest-functioning folks like you need some down time every now and then.
aries,20210723,Keep both feet firmly planted on the ground today -- it's not a good time for fantasies or for too much ambition. You can get your way as long as you are realistic about it.
aries,20210724,"Try to blaze new ground today -- your energy is best spent pioneering. You may need to go it alone, because things are a bit too dicey for some of your stodgier friends or colleagues."
aries,20210725,"It's time to show off your leadership skills. Some know full well what you can do, while others need to see it firsthand. Take charge of that meeting or ask the one question that gets everyone thinking."
aries,20210726,"Something or someone comes to you in a dream -- but don't be scared! It may be difficult to understand, but this message is vital to your understanding of something big that's coming up soon."
aries,20210727,"Your karmic balance is in need of a little readjustment, so make sure that you're doing good deeds, thinking good thoughts and generally trying to make your world a better place."
aries,20210728,
aries,20210729,"Today is all about spontaneity, so ignore your calendar items and just try to wing it as much as possible. With energy like yours, it's hard to see how things could go wrong. Have fun with your people!"
aries,20210730,"Your financial condition needs a tweak or two -- so get busy! Your sense of the situation is clearer than it has been in ages, and that means you can make practical changes with confidence."
aries,20210731,Today is all about the things in your life -- from furniture to art to loose change. You may want to reappraise their value to you and purge anything that isn't serving a purpose anymore.
aries,20210801,"You're moving slowly today -- which is a good thing! A fast pace is sure to end up costing you valuable time when you are forced to backtrack, so just take the day one step at a time."
aries,20210802,You've got it easy today! Enjoy the freedom to take care of something you've been meaning to do for ages -- or just kick back and take a break. You certainly deserve one after the last month!
aries,20210803,It's all about communication today-- and you are right in the thick of it all! You may find yourself chatting with total strangers even if that's far from your typical behavior. Enjoy it!
aries,20210804,"Your softer side is out in the open today, and you should find that your people are making life easier on you as a result. It's a great time to push for deeper relationships or just to hang out with family."
aries,20210805,"Your deepest emotional connections are highlighted today -- old friends, family members and your partner are all in the spotlight. Give them what they need and honor what you've got together."

aries,20210808,"Your boundless energy is perfect for engaging with kids of all ages. You may feel quite a bit younger yourself, so don't be too surprised if you end up making games out of your daily tasks."
aries,20210809,"Today lacks excitement -- but that might be just what you need. Try not to wish for an adrenaline rush, as you may get a lot more trouble than you had hoped. Sometimes boredom is optimal."
aries,20210810,Sometimes you just need to take care of the boring stuff -- those to-do items that seem to stick to your list tenaciously. Cross off as many of them as you can today to make tomorrow brighter.
aries,20210811,"Your selfish side is taking the day off -- so look around and see who needs your help! You can rack up some serious karma, but of course you don't care until the ego gets back from its trip."
aries,20210812,"Think about what that person in front of you really wants before taking action -- they are almost certainly not revealing the whole truth. It's not too hard to figure it out, though!"
aries,20210813,"Charm is your best friend today, so make sure that you're thinking it all through before you try to get anything from anyone. Your best bet is to hear them out before making your case."
aries,20210814,Things are going on deep within you that you can't understand -- but you don't have to! You're in a really good position to make a difference when it comes to family or other group dynamics.
aries,20210815,"Your emotions are running the gamut from manically happy to down in the dumps and back again -- it can get exhausting! Try not to worry too much about where the roulette wheel ends up, though."
aries,20210816,"Now is the time to think differently and push yourself to try new things. You are sure to find that your great energy can help you to make a real difference in the world, and people take notice."

aries,20210818,"Your drive is more powerful than ever, so make sure that you're pushing yourself to new extremes. It's a really good day for crafting new plans and exploring your ambition. Things are on the upswing."
aries,20210819,"Take advantage of this new opportunity before anyone else sees it -- there may not be room for everyone! Sure, it's a little selfish, but it's the kind of selfish that isn't a negative."
aries,20210820,You need to reach further and try to get something new locked down for the upcoming year. Your ambitions are achievable as long as you can keep your mind on track. Things are looking up!
aries,20210821,"Set goals today -- you may need to replace a few, as you've had some serious success lately. Now is a good time to figure out what you want and how to get there. Things are moving along nicely for you!"
aries,20210822,"Today's issue is of vital importance, so do your best to take it seriously -- even if it seems silly on the surface. You can't get it figured out without some help, and a friend comes by at just the right time."
aries,20210823,This isn't a good time to try new endeavors -- not even those that seem like they are the best of ideas. Your energy is just better suited to cleaning up old problems or motoring along on the same paths.
aries,20210824,It's just a little too easy to get frustrated today -- so make sure that you're not taking out that energy on other people. Try to find creative outlets for any negative emotions you may feel.
aries,20210825,"You need to use this great energy to take action -- it could be almost anything, really. The important thing is to get moving and stay in motion so you don't have time to think too hard."
aries,20210826,"You're exploring new territory today -- maybe in the company of coworkers, maybe on your own entirely. The terrific energy that courses through you as you make discoveries is its own reward!"
aries,20210827,"It's vital that you remain as patient as you can be today -- otherwise, you're sure to end up in trouble with someone important. It's a really good time to deal with old issues that have started to pile up."
aries,20210828,"A new obstacle blocks your path and keeps you from pushing forward as quickly as you would like. That's fine, though -- new information is coming your way that is sure to change your mind about your work."
aries,20210829,"You need to be as clear as you can be today -- otherwise, you might end up confusing the wrong person. Communication is all-important right now, so that means that you've got to try twice as hard."
aries,20210830,"An argument flares up between you and a friend or colleague -- and it needs to run its course. That doesn't mean pursuing your opponent if they back down, just that closure is a must."
aries,20210831,"You are starting in a new direction today -- even if it doesn't feel life it. Your initiative is key to your success, so even if you don't feel like doing anything, force yourself to get out there."
aries,20210901,You can get a lot done even if your energy levels are low. You may find that you need to motivate yourself with lots of little rewards or just drink enough coffee to shake up a moose.
aries,20210902,"Emotionally, you are at your peak right now. It's a great time to work on old issues that have bothered you in the past and may be holding you back from a brighter future. Do the work!"
aries,20210903,"You need to avoid the friction that is going down today -- otherwise, you may find that your energy is wasted on small-scale conflict. You feel too good to get drawn into silly struggles."
aries,20210904,You're feeling the heat and it has nothing to do with weather! You should find that your energy levels are peaking and that you need to get out there and do something physical. Enjoy what you've got!
aries,20210905,Try not to be overly critical today -- though you are sorely tempted to let people know just what you think! It's one of those days when you need to be more careful of others' feelings.
aries,20210906,"Slow down and get everything right today -- or at least as much as you can. Speeding up is almost guaranteed to backfire, so don't move any more quickly than you absolutely must. This phase is almost complete."
aries,20210907,"A minor accident gets blown out of proportion by those around you who are prone to panic. Calm them down as much as you can, but try not to get too wrapped up in their mini-drama."
aries,20210908,"All you have to do today is listen -- at least one person has something they need to tell you that is vital to both of you. It's not so hard, and it doesn't take that long. In the end, you're glad you did."
aries,20210909,You could charm the birds from the trees today -- and you may need to do something equally impressive if you want to make the most of this terrific energy. Don't be brash when you can be persuasive.
aries,20210910,Your emotional side is in need of some attention -- and you can make a real difference if you attend to your feelings. See if your people can give you the space you need to take care of this.
aries,20210911,"You're moving more slowly today, which could make life pretty tough for those you work with closely. That's not the end of the world, though -- you may spot something important."
aries,20210912,"Your active energy makes your day exciting and vibrant -- so get out there and do something wild! Even if you feel subdued or under the weather, you can still have a good time."
aries,20210913,"Explore some new territory today -- you can hardly help yourself. Your amazing energy is driving you in exciting new directions, and you may as well learn the lay of the land while you're at it."
aries,20210914,"It's vital that you stay grounded today -- otherwise, you may find yourself far afield when you need to be focused. It's a great time to seek out support from friends or family members."
aries,20210915,"Self-confidence is rarely a problem for you, but today you need to ensure that your reserves are topped off. You can break through to great success, but only if you really believe."
aries,20210916,"You're a visionary! Today brings a new way of seeing the world, and you may be more excited than anyone else in the room. Share what you see and you are quite likely to inspire a few colleagues."
aries,20210917,Think more about the long-term today -- your ideas are better suited to intricate plans than immediate tactical deployment. You should be able to deal with people who are short-sighted.
aries,20210918,"Don't worry too much about what goes on today -- though it's likely to be positive. Instead, you need to focus your intellect on the long-term. It's easier than you may realize."
aries,20210919,"Events might not make much sense at first, but once you start seeing them as rooted in karma, it all adds up. Past actions are just now starting to reverberate in your life and nearby."
aries,20210920,You need to use your powers to help others -- so make sure that you're looking out for problems to fix. Things should start to get a lot more interesting by the end of the day.

aries,20210924,"You feel extra-social today, and you should find that others feel the same way -- at least when you're around. You should be able to make some progress in an area that had once seemed totally impossible."
aries,20210925,Try not to dive too deeply into any emotional business today -- you've got to keep things on surface-level as much as you can. Your energy is best spent on mundane activities anyway.
aries,20210926,"You've got a way with people right now, and you may find that you're casually flirting with folks whom you wouldn't ordinarily feel comfortable with. Go for it! Things can change for the better now."
aries,20210927,You could coast through the day if you feel like it -- or you could take advantage of the frictionless surface you're gliding on to make amazing progress toward an important goal. Your call!
aries,20210928,"Your intuitive side is giving you all sorts of new insights. You may find that you need to ask yourself some big questions to get the pump primed, but then you should be good to go for some time."
aries,20210929,You're not feeling quite up to snuff today -- but everybody needs some down time now and then! Take a sick day if you need one and just try to take care of the basics. Quiet can be fun!
aries,20210930,"Your active energy is practically forcing you to get busy today. Things are looking up for sure, so keep on moving and you should be able to make amazing progress before much time passes."
aries,20211001,"Love is in the air -- it's irresistible! Your great energy makes you more attractive than ever, and you should find that you're getting attention from the right person. Enjoy and live it up!"
aries,20211002,It's easy for you to dream up new ideas today -- creativity is your best asset! Follow up anything that sounds good and see where you end up. You may need to coax someone who's a bit timid.
aries,20211003,"Someone is stressing you out today -- possibly so much that you need to start a fight. Try to avoid any serious dust-ups, but it's okay if you bare your fangs a bit. Show them you mean business!"
aries,20211004,"A new challenge comes your way -- but it's one you can handle. It may be that it's a test of some sort, so take it seriously and hope for the best. The harder you work, the better things should go for you."
aries,20211005,"Now is the perfect time to get started on something new. It could be a project or a business deal, but you need to make sure that you're focused on what's most important to you."
aries,20211006,"A quick wave of selfishness passes over you today, forcing you to rethink something that had once seemed ironclad. It's easy to put this feeling off for some other time (or maybe get rid of it entirely)."
aries,20211007,"As long as you can focus on someone else's needs, today should go swimmingly for you both. It's easier for you to help with someone else's goals than to achieve your own for now."
aries,20211008,You are feeling unusually introverted today -- so don't force yourself into any tense social situations. It's a good time for you to check in with any projects that may need individual attention.
aries,20211009,There's just a wee bit too much going on beneath the surface -- so make sure that you're ready to deal with the cavalcade of pent-up feelings that seem to be taking over your life. It gets better soon!
aries,20211010,"Cultural inspiration is coming your way. It could be artistic or literary or almost anything else, but you should be able to weave some new threads into your tapestry by the end of the day."
aries,20211011,"You are thinking big today -- and others may not fully understand you. That's not your problem, so don't worry too much about how long it may take for them to catch up with your ideas."
aries,20211012,"Don't panic when things start to get weird today -- you can handle this! Your energy is a bit flat, but that can actually work to your advantage if you open up to it and just let it happen."
aries,20211013,"Your ambitions are making life a little stressful -- and a little exciting! It's easy to see how driven you are, and the right people are ready to see you in a whole new way. Go for it!"
aries,20211014,"Today requires careful planning on your part -- and fortunately, your thinking is deliberate. It's a great time to absorb all the variables and come up with something bold and unexpected."
aries,20211015,"You reach a new level of achievement today -- one that is hardly surprising, but still quite welcome. You should be able to leverage it into something bigger and even better, so move forward."
aries,20211016,"You're not at the top of your game -- especially if you're focused on stuff that is personal. If you direct that energy toward others, you are much more likely to have a positive impact."
aries,20211017,Don't dismiss today's major issue -- even if it seems kind of silly at first glance. You need to take it seriously if you want to keep it from growing out of control. It should be manageable now.
aries,20211018,"You feel like making a real difference today -- and it's easy to see why! Your energy is peaking in every part of your life, and you should be able to pursue nearly any ambition that you like."

aries,20211020,"Your diplomatic skills are making life great for everyone today -- so open up and let people see your charming side! It's a great time for negotiations of any kind, from business to romance."
aries,20211021,"A financial transaction makes you question a rather important component of your life -- but it's less of a problem than an opportunity. Roll with it and see where it leads, but don't break the bank."
aries,20211022,"You're a little worried about clutter -- or possibly a notable absence in your home furnishings. Whichever way the pendulum has swung, you need to help guide it back to balance."
aries,20211023,"Your fun, flirty energy keeps those around you active and engaged throughout the day. If you're single, now is a great time to show interest in one or more hotties. If you're partnered, try not to make them too jealous!"
aries,20211024,"When did life get this easy? Spoiler alert -- things are due to return to normal pretty soon, so you may want to coast along as much as you can before you have to actually start working again."
aries,20211025,"A family member comes to you with a problem or concern that only you can help with. It may interfere with your plans, but your obligations are shaping your life for the better, so go ahead and help out."
aries,20211026,Today is perfect for thinking about energy and how you use it -- but not so much for actually doing things with it. You're more reflective and can make sense of more than mundane concerns.
aries,20211027,"Kids feature in your day in some way. If you've got some of your own, it's a no-brainer; if not, you may get called upon to watch over some young ones or end up yelling at rowdy teens."
aries,20211028,"Boredom comes far too easily today -- but so does action! If you can keep busy, you are sure to be all smiles, but if you slow down, time may feel as if it's standing still. Keep moving!"
aries,20211029,"A child is the key to your happiness today. If you're a parent, that's a no-brainer, but if not, you may find yourself drawn to a friend's family, or you may just end up helping a lost kid at the park."
aries,20211030,"Details start to get pretty irritating today -- so make sure that you're ready to deal with them face to face. If you don't, they are sure to pile up and cause real trouble down the line."
aries,20211031,"A minor health problem may fan the flames of hypochondria today -- but you may as well get it checked out, just in case. While you're at it, you may as well adjust your life to be more healthful."
aries,20211101,"Now is the best time to get started on a new project. It could be anything. Your energy is definitely focused outward, and if you direct it somewhere new, you're sure to find that things improve."
aries,20211102,"Now is a good time to check in with that one troubled friend or relative. You can really help them, maybe just by showing concern. Every scrap of karma you earn will come in handy soon."
aries,20211103,"Pay careful attention to what people are saying and you can't go wrong. Misunderstandings are the likeliest cause of problems and stress right now, but you can rise above it all."
aries,20211104,"You're not feeling as comfortable as you would like with this new social situation, but the good news is that you can get along fine with whoever it is that's causing you such stress. Just smile and nod."
aries,20211105,"A renewal of sorts is underway, and it's making you a little excited and a little apprehensive. It should be totally positive in the long run, but it might sting a bit for now."
aries,20211106,"You're at the cutting edge of something big and new, so act like it! Your great energy is perfect for leading the way toward something fresh and exciting and cool. Show the world what it's missing!"
aries,20211107,"Honesty is everything right now even if that means that you need to step on someone else's feelings a wee bit. You should be able to get to the bottom of the problem quickly, though."
aries,20211108,"It's way too easy for you to bump up your career or some either external factor over family ties, so try to do right by your people. It may be as simple as letting them know you're working late."
aries,20211109,"All you can think about is how other people see you, which can be a hard cycle to break. Try to do one positive thing that others can see and then move on to whatever else feels right to you."
aries,20211110,"Today is all about teamwork, and you can get along better than ever with your peers. You're also a good leader, of course, but you may be better off working as an equal for the time being."
aries,20211111,"You're in a good place, but you can see an even better one on the horizon. Now is a good time to blaze trails and try to find the perfect spot to make your new home base. Pioneering can be fun!"
aries,20211112,"An unclear message is coming your way, but there's not much you can do to understand it. That leaves two options: ignore your doubt and press ahead or wait another day or two."
aries,20211113,"Try not to sign anything new today, even a lease or employment agreement. It's not that it's dooming you to failure, just that this isn't the most auspicious time to start something new."
aries,20211114,You need to step up to the front of the line and take your rightful place. Your amazing energy should help you to leap over any barriers in your way and keep your peers from grumbling.
aries,20211115,"You could meet someone new and very different today, so much so that you might end up switching directions and trying something really unusual before the day is over. Enjoy the rush!"
aries,20211116,"Patience is especially important today, so make sure that you're taking all the time you need with that one person or problem. Your energy is ready for some downtime anyway!"
aries,20211117,"Don't worry too much about that obstacle in your path. It's much less important than it seems. In fact, it might be simpler to just go at it than to try to think up ways to get around it."
aries,20211118,"Your hard work is coming to a head today, and you may find that you need to step back and let the results speak for themselves. Your energy is right for building on your success."
aries,20211119,"Things are moving more quickly today, and you're right in the thick of it all! Your great energy should help you motivate people and get folks to do whatever they ought to be doing."
aries,20211120,"It's a good day for purchases but better for practical stuff like computers or furniture than for gadgets or toys. You should be able to get a good deal, especially if you're buying from someone who's willing to haggle."
aries,20211121,"An older relative is making trouble for you, but there's good news too! You may find that you've got what it takes to turn their attitude all the way around. Just go easy at first."
aries,20211122,"Your first reaction may not be your best, but it's good enough, and suppressing it just makes things worse. Let others know how you feel in no uncertain terms. Things are getting better!"
aries,20211123,"Try to give everyone the time and space they need to speak clearly and from the heart. You may not like what you hear, but it's important that you give them the chance to say it all."
aries,20211124,Take action today even if you're not sure you're on the right path! It's one of those days when you're likely to have to make more than a few judgment calls. You can clean up later.
aries,20211125,A big adventure is yours for the taking today. All you have to do is step up and claim it! You may find that someone close is aching to come along but just can't quite bring themselves to ask you.
aries,20211126,"Try to do something that will boost your health today, and then try to make a habit of it! It's easier than ever to make incremental changes, so you shouldn't have a hard time getting there."
aries,20211127,"When you see someone in trouble today, you feel obligated to step up and help, and that is exactly the right attitude! Your energy is perfect for protecting others and solving problems."
aries,20211128,"Hold back your criticism today. At least one person just can't take any more. It's not just you, of course. They're just emotionally fragile. You can score points by offering a shoulder to cry on."
aries,20211129,"A surprising development forces you to shift gears and turn away from your own issues. It may be work related, but it's more likely a friend or family member in need that draws your attention."
aries,20211130,"If you're confused today, and you likely will be at some point, just listen carefully. People are communicating a little oddly, but you can still figure it all out if you take the time."
aries,20211201,It's way too easy for you to get caught up in emotional games that you don't see coming today. It might feel like you've been ambushed. Just roll with it and see how you like the outcome.
aries,20211202,"Your emotional side is getting a workout today, for better or worse. For the most part, you should end up feeling more positive by day's end, but you're just as likely to feel exhausted."
aries,20211203,It's likely that life is slowing you down regardless of your speed. Just let things happen at their own pace until you figure out what it is that's holding you back.
aries,20211204,You need to express your individuality today. Make sure that your way of thinking is fully understood by those around you. It's easier than you think to make everything clear.
aries,20211205,"If you're in doubt, take action. Your fiery energy helps you to see that things are just right for you to move ahead quickly, and you should still succeed even if you have to improvise."
aries,20211206,"You feel totally focused on ambition today, and there's nothing wrong with that! You know you'll get back to other things when the time is right. For now, keep pushing!"
aries,20211207,"You may find that you're able to jump right on top of a new opportunity as soon as it arises. Things may start to get really chaotic, but that just means your preparation pays off even more!"
aries,20211208,"You hit a new milestone today, one you may not have seen coming. Sometimes your ambitions exceed your expectations, and it's days like today that show you why it's the expectations that need to change."
aries,20211209,"Keep moving forward even if things look dire (they probably aren't). Your goals and ambitions are highlighted on a day like today, and you ought to be able to get moving without a hitch."
aries,20211210,"Something small is rapidly turning into something big, and that's a problem! Even if it seems good on its face, you can bet that it's going to be more trouble than it's worth. Nip it in the bud."
aries,20211211,"This isn't the time to run off in new directions. You are much better off sticking with what you know and love. Your time is coming soon, so gather your energy and prepare for a brighter day."
aries,20211212,"It's definitely time for you to take action. Your amazing energy is perfect for getting things done, and the more you move, the faster you go. Expect greatness and you'll make it happen!"
aries,20211213,"Explore some new territory, maybe social, maybe physical. Your great personal energy is driving you inevitably forward, so you might as well make the most of the restlessness."
aries,20211214,"Your financial situation is a little weird today, but that just means you need to find a good solution, and you're full of answers! Of course, you might need to consult someone who knows how things really are."
aries,20211215,"Is it time to sell some stuff? You might be sick to death of your crowded house, but there are lots of ways to get rid of the excess. Things might be a little better for you afterward as long as you don't immediately go shopping."
aries,20211216,"Something small is easier than it appears, so get it out of the way first and then build on your momentum! It's a great time for you to step up and ask for help from friends too."
aries,20211217,"It's a good time to communicate with your people even if you're not in the same room, or even the same continent! You should be able to reach out and let them know what's going on with ease."
aries,20211218,"Your emotional side is making a play for control today, but you may as well stand back and let it do what it wants. It's certainly easier, and you might find that things start to make more sense."
aries,20211219,A family issue takes over your schedule today. You may have to completely ignore other aspects of your life. The good news is that you're perfectly suited to handle this interruption with care.
aries,20211220,"How do you get along with your parents? That is the main issue of the day in one way or another. It could be pretty remote, for all sorts of reasons, but you are likely to be reflecting on family issues."
aries,20211221,"A romantic option comes your way that makes you wonder what's really going on. Things could be a lot clearer! Still, your energy is good enough that you can make the most of this opportunity."
aries,20211222,"A new idea strikes you when you least expect it, and you may find that you're in a much better position as a result. See if you can get your people to support you as you make your play."
aries,20211223,"Your routines are keeping you sane today, so make sure you're sticking to the schedule as much as you can. Things are sure to look even better in the near future if you can keep it up."
aries,20211224,"It may not be the most exciting time you've ever had, but you still have to make sure that you're covering all your bases and taking care of your mundane tasks. Thing should start to pick up in a few days!"
aries,20211225,"Your eyes are starting to cross from all the crazy little details you're expected to keep up with. You still need to find a way, though, so drink another cup of coffee."
aries,20211226,It's easier than usual to get your way as long as you're polite. One step outside the lines and you may find yourself facing a sea of stony faces. Just keep smiling and the world is yours!
aries,20211227,"Now is the time to start on a new endeavor. It could be almost anything from a startup to a new romance, but your energy is eagerly awaiting your next big step. Take it in style!"
aries,20211228,"You're not totally comfortable with someone who has been a part of your life for just a short time, but the good news is that the situation is just about to resolve without any action on your part."
aries,20211229,"You still don't feel quite right, but it's a small price to pay for the healing and renewal that's going on under the surface. Make sure that you're checking in with the right people today."
aries,20211230,"You feel a wee bit frazzled today, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Take it as a sign to spend some time on your own. Even if you're not getting stuff done, you can still be spiritually productive."
aries,20211231,"You take to the next new thing as if you've been waiting for it your whole life, and maybe you have! In any case, your terrific energy is perfect for stirring up enthusiasm in those around you."
aries,20220101,"A cultural event holds special interest for you, though you might not see it coming. Just embrace it without fear or worry and you should find yourself enjoying it immensely."
taurus,20210101,"A mediator needs to step in. Is it you? If it's not your fight, offer your judgment, but if you're wrapped up in a struggle, you need to be the first to call for an outside arbitrator. It's the only way."
taurus,20210102,"Today is all about attachment, so make sure that you're paying close attention to what's holding you down and what's keeping you secure. You may be able to cut some ties while strengthening others."
taurus,20210103,"You might need to deal with someone who may be just a bit too attached to you or an idea or an organization. Your energy is terrific, so you should be able to find a good way to say the right thing."
taurus,20210104,"Your emotional side rules the day, in a good way! You should find that your ability to express what you're feeling is enhanced, which should put at least one person at ease."
taurus,20210105,"What do you need to do to take care of your health? It could be almost anything from one better meal every day to a brand-new daily exercise routine, but now is the time to get started."
taurus,20210106,"Enlist a friend in your new quest for health. You're not the only one who wants to eat better and get more exercise, and it's easier to stick to a plan if you have a buddy who doubles as an enforcer!"
taurus,20210107,"You're feeling a sense of ownership over something that might not really be yours, so try to let go as much as you can. It's a really good time for you to reconsider how you feel about things and people."
taurus,20210108,"Your energy is conflicted today, so much so that you might find it harder to relate to certain people. Try your best to just wait for this emotional phase to pass by."
taurus,20210109,"You need to avoid the temptation to talk over others today, though it may end up being too hard to resist. It's hard to get people to take you seriously if you start preaching, though."
taurus,20210110,"Your subconscious mind is causing all sorts of interesting problems today, and some of them may prove to be quite handy. See if you can get your people to cover for you as you explore your inner space."
taurus,20210111,"Someone who seems holy, or at least spiritual, could enter your life today, possibly for the second or third time. This time, you're ready to hear what they have to say, so pay close attention!"
taurus,20210112,"Your deeply held ideals are making your life a lot more interesting today, so don't hide them. Your great energy helps you make real progress on something that means a lot to you and the world."
taurus,20210113,"Enlightenment is spreading fast, so hop on and get some for yourself! You may also want to affect the way it's being absorbed, because your own brand of wisdom is dominant right now."
taurus,20210114,"You and a friend or colleague are butting heads again, but don't back down this time. It may be irritating, but you should be able to make some progress once this phase is over. It won't take long."
taurus,20210115,"Your conservative nature could be challenged by someone with a big, bold, new idea that they can't seem to let go of. Exercise restraint."
taurus,20210116,"Don't do anything on your own today. You need companionship and possibly assistance to get anything done. Your energy is strong but diffuse, so it's hard for you to do anything in depth."
taurus,20210117,"A glimmer of understanding blossoms into full-on enlightenment today. You don't need to act right away, but you may want to explore this new wisdom of yours to see what it all means."
taurus,20210118,"Shopping is ill-advised now, at least for you. It's not that you're going to make a dumb deal, just that the material world isn't really the place you need to focus your energy on for now."
taurus,20210119,It's one of those days when you really need to figure out what you're doing next and consider every last option. You're sure to hit on it even if it takes you all day.
taurus,20210120,"Your artistic side is fully engaged right now, so make sure that you're giving it your all. Things may get a little weird for you if you don't find a creative outlet, but your energy is too good to let this pass."
taurus,20210121,"Your amazing nergy helps you pull off a major coup: proving your loyalty to someone who doubts you without having to get your hands dirty. It's a big win, so be sure to enjoy it."
taurus,20210122,"Today feels like a colossal waste of time, but still you need to make sure that you're at least going through the motions. Someone close needs your attention, and you might as well give it to them."
taurus,20210123,"This is not a good time for financial decisions, so make sure that you're not on the hook for anything like that today. If you must put money down somewhere, you should probably play it safe."
taurus,20210124,"Try to avoid committing yourself to anything long term. Your energy is best spent on regular daily projects, and you should try to defer any new agreements for a few days."
taurus,20210125,"Speak from the heart today or don't speak at all! People find it easier to discern emotional truth, but that also means that they're better prepared to deal with the consequences."
taurus,20210126,"You’re comfortable in your steady routine, but going outside it every once in a while provides you with some thrilling memories that can last a lifetime."
taurus,20210127,"You may be mired in a power struggle that is more about ego than anything of importance. If you can let go, do so, but if the stakes are high, call for reinforcements."
taurus,20210128,"Your pomposity only flares up once in a blue moon, but when it does, you have to be careful! Things could be weird today, so you might have to take a few teasing words before you lighten up."
taurus,20210129,"You and a friend or colleague are butting heads, which isn't much fun for anyone. That could just mean that you all need to settle down. On the other hand, they may take the advantage of you. It's a tough call."
taurus,20210130,"You're having so much fun that you might accidentally skip out of work or forget something else, but your great energy should help you cope with the consequences, if there are any."
taurus,20210131,"Your love life could get an exciting boost, no matter what your current status may be. You could get a message from an online hottie or an invitation to an intimate weekend from your beloved."
taurus,20210201,"Your life is not as boring as you think, especially when you work your great energy to try something new. It doesn't take much to engage your appetite for fun and novelty."
taurus,20210202,"Your life is more exciting than usual today thanks to a bit of news from far afield. It shakes up your routine, but sometimes that's for the best! Live it up."
taurus,20210203,"Your beliefs could be called into question today, so do your best to either confirm them or blow them off. You should find that things start to improve dramatically once you do."
taurus,20210204,"Your feelings run deep today, so pay close attention to them. You may find that you're being pointed subtly in a new direction. Go for it. Now is the time!"
taurus,20210205,"You're deeply passionate about something or someone, and today brings that to the surface in a way you can't deny. Make sure that you are doing whatever it takes to be true to yourself."

taurus,20210209,"Your emotions are firmly grounded in reality today, and you find it easier than usual to confront bullies or arrive at hard truths with family members. You can move the world if you must!"
taurus,20210210,"You are in a deep struggle that may involve two very different factions, maybe within yourself! It's a good time to get your priorities in order so you can get past this madness."
taurus,20210211,"You are firmly on the side of the status quo, for now, anyway. Make sure that you're dealing with people who are screaming about change, because they could affect your immediate and medium-range plans."
taurus,20210212,"Your people are key to your good times today, so make sure they know what they mean to you. Reach out as far as you need to to get everyone on board with your big plans. There's strength in numbers."
taurus,20210213,"You may not feel like leaning on others' shoulders, but you've got to make sure that you're telling your problems to at least one close friend or co-worker. It's a good day to get the help you need!"
taurus,20210214,"This isn't a good time for shopping or even considering making purchases. Focus on spirituality, romance, or any other aspect of life, because materialism just doesn't work for you right now."
taurus,20210215,"You need to shop around today, figuratively speaking! Your finances still need to stay locked up tight, but you should consider plenty of alternatives for any choice you have to make."
taurus,20210216,"Your great energy is coursing through every fiber of your being today. It's hard not to feel terrific when this happens! See if you can get your people to follow your lead, because your instincts are good."

taurus,20210219,"You feel somewhat out of sorts today, so much so that you're drawing attention to yourself. It's a good time for you to kick back and just let things happen (even if you want to scream)."
taurus,20210220,"You're moving faster than ever, maybe too fast! Try not to make any serious mistakes, or you may cost yourself that lead you're starting to build. Slow and steady wins the race!"
taurus,20210221,"Speak from the heart as soon as possible! Your energy is just right for communicating difficult feelings, and you should get the best possible reception, especially from close family members."
taurus,20210222,"It's a good time to gather around a meal. It can be at home with family or out with colleagues, but you're at your best combining the social with the earthy."
taurus,20210223,"You feel happier than you have in a while, no matter what's going on in your life. Some part of you is smiling, so focus on that and the rest should take care of itself. Encourage others to do the same!"
taurus,20210224,"It's too easy for you to fill up with hot air today, so do what you can to just chill out and let others take the lead. You're sure to find that your people are willing to cut you some slack for the downtime."
taurus,20210225,"Your self-confidence is blowing up out of proportion in others' eyes, so try to just calm down and let others sing your praises, even if it takes them too long to get tuned up."

taurus,20210228,"Your family and other social attachments are strengthening your life today, so make the most of them and ensure that your people know what they mean to you. Things are really looking up!"
taurus,20210301,"Your health should be your first concern today, so make sure that you're doing something about it! You may find that your energy level is somewhat lower until you make one little tweak."
taurus,20210302,You need a buddy if you want to stick with your exercise or that new diet or whatever else you're trying to do to make a positive change in your life. Find a friend or family member to join you.
taurus,20210303,"You could be feeling a bit needier than usual today, and it could come across as possessiveness. Try to be clear about what you expect and your people should understand how to help."
taurus,20210304,Focus on your close friendships and family relationships today. Your social energy requires a bit of intimacy to really get going. You can help your people take steps toward a better life.

taurus,20210306,"You're getting plenty of signals from deep within your subconscious mind, so make sure that you're aware that they're present and distinct from what's actually happening around you!"
taurus,20210307,"You meet someone new who makes you rethink an important belief or assumption, but with great energy like this, it's sure to keep you on your toes. You may find that life gets a little simpler as a result."
taurus,20210308,"Your idealism is pushing boundaries all over the place, which is a good thing! At least one person needs to get schooled on right and wrong, though. Are you up for the task?"
taurus,20210309,"You need to butt heads today, but it might be hard to find a worthy opponent! Make sure you're not just antagonizing anyone who comes near. Know how to pick the right battle."
taurus,20210310,"You could be feeling somewhat conservative today, but not so much that you can't see which way the wind is blowing. Still, you need to stand up for some aspect of the past that is worth saving."
taurus,20210311,Try not to go it alone today. Things indicate that you could require backup. That could mean anything from getting help with a work project to getting a second opinion on what color to paint your bathroom.
taurus,20210312,"Your intuition is especially active right now, and you might be able to get your friends or family to see things your way if you open up. A new understanding helps you to make sense of it all."
taurus,20210313,"You need to keep your wallet on a tight leash today. Otherwise, you could vastly outspend your means. That isn't to say you should avoid all purchases, just that you should be very skeptical."
taurus,20210314,Take your time reaching decisions today. You've got to look through all your options before you lock yourself into anything. It's one of those days when everything can work out well.
taurus,20210315,"Someone close is in a big rush and they need you to either follow along or get out of the way! That's aggravating, but at least you can let them run off to do whatever while you take care of what's really important."
taurus,20210316,"Your artsy side is apparent today, and you should find that those around you are drawn to you in a new way. It's a good time to take visit a gallery or show off your own creative work."
taurus,20210317,"Your terrific energy makes it easy to feel confident in your friends and colleagues today, so make sure that you're communicating with them! You should find that at least one of them really steps up."
taurus,20210318,"Today could feel like a colossal waste of time if you choose to see it that way. Alternatively, you could look on it as a way to kick back, make plans, and reconsider what you want out of life."
taurus,20210319,"This is not a good time to make a big financial decision, or little one, really. Try to defer all your plans for at least a few days so you can get all the facts you need and feel more solid about your choices."
taurus,20210320,It's still not a good time to enter agreements or try to get anywhere with job searches. You're much better off staying home and working on your issues there if that's possible.
taurus,20210321,"You might need to push yourself a little in order to take advantage of today's romantic energy. Take a risk! Tell someone how you really feel, or ask out that cutie from down the hall."
taurus,20210322,"Open up! Your emotional energy is quite powerful now, but it doesn't do anyone any good if you keep it to yourself. Find the right person, then speak from the heart. It's easy!"
taurus,20210323,"You have to spend some serious time building bridges today. At least one potential ally isn't quite sure you're a good match. You know better, so reach out and do whatever it takes."
taurus,20210324,"A conflict could get ugly, so make sure that you've got someone from outside who can mediate fairly between all parties. That may be more important than knowing who ends up winning."
taurus,20210325,"You have to deal with someone (or possibly a pet) who's suffering from an attachment disorder. This can manifest in all sorts of ways, but you can handle it with great sympathy."
taurus,20210326,"You're feeling closer than ever to someone, or maybe to an idea that has long held sway over your life. Now is the best time to dive in even deeper until you can't feel boundaries anymore!"
taurus,20210327,"Your emotional side is making life a lot more interesting now, so pay careful attention and speak clearly. As long as your people know where you're at, all should be well."
taurus,20210328,"Try not to overdo your latest craze even if it feels really great or seems totally healthy. Too much of anything is bad for you, especially given your slightly obsessive energy. Give it a rest!"
taurus,20210329,"You may have bitten off more than you can chew, and yes, that is possible! Your desire for more is likely coming from the wrong place, but you can easily shift gears to something better."
taurus,20210330,"Your popularity could take a hit today, but it's actually for the best! Something you said or did was essential even if almost nobody liked it. It can be hard to be this responsible, but someone has to do it!"
taurus,20210331,You are feeling a bit jealous of a friend or colleague who got a sweet deal or maybe stole away some person or project you were fond of. This is not the time to act on those feelings!
taurus,20210401,Your skepticism is well founded today. You're about to learn that something isn't quite as terrific as it seemed at first glance. Soften the blow for those close to you so you can all move forward.
taurus,20210402,Try to focus on financial issues today. You have to get your head wrapped around your expenses and income if you want to make it past your next obstacle. It's easier than you think!
taurus,20210403,"You're firmly rooted in the ground today, which could mean it's time for a heart-to-heart talk with your partner, or maybe you need to go for a long walk outside. Go forward boldly!"
taurus,20210404,"It's a really positive day for you, so make the most of this energy! You need to make sure that you're sticking to the schedule as much as you can, but that shouldn't be too hard for you."
taurus,20210405,"Your conservative side is out in force today, though it may just be pining for old times rather than making political or social statements. Try not to get dragged into any big fights!"
taurus,20210406,"Something small irritates you in a big way today, probably pretty early. Try not to make too big a deal out of it. You should be able to get things back on track by tomorrow at the latest."
taurus,20210407,"You're feeling pretty good about your place in the world, and the future looks even brighter! Your great energy helps you navigate at least one tricky situation with flair."
taurus,20210408,"Think big today, especially when it comes to your social life. You may not need to reach out to every last friend you have, but you should make an effort to say hello to most of them."
taurus,20210409,"Though you're usually pretty stable and sensible, sometimes you need to break out of that middle ground and try something crazy. Today is perfect for wild schemes and nonsense, so go for it!"
taurus,20210410,"Your laid-back nature is asserting itself with a vengeance today, so make sure that you don't have any important deadlines staring you in the face. If so, try to get extensions or assistance!"
taurus,20210411,"You could run into some difficulties thanks in part to people who aren't letting you off the hook for something that shouldn't be a big problem. It's not fair, but it also doesn't go on forever."
taurus,20210412,You're feeling too good not to enjoy whatever is going on today. Make sure that your people get to share in your good mood as much as possible.
taurus,20210413,"It's a good day to hunker down with your favorite entertainment. Maybe you want to binge-watch a new show or read a new mystery novel. Whatever it is, this is the time to enjoy it!"
taurus,20210414,"Try to look at things carefully today. You need to make sure that you're really paying attention to the details. Your energy is a bit diffuse, which makes it all the more important to handle things with care."
taurus,20210415,"You aren't quite yourself today, which could cause those around you to ask what's wrong. You could get quite irritated by this, but do your best to stay pleasant."
taurus,20210416,"You're moving at a quicker pace than you'd like, but there's not much you can do about it yet. Try to get your people to keep up with you so you don't have to play the waiting game."
taurus,20210417,"You need to power up your intuition to deal with a major hassle. The good news is that once you get that one key insight, more start coming until you're a veritable font of wisdom!"
taurus,20210418,"You could get some great news today. Most likely it relates to a request you made a while back, but it could come from almost anywhere. It may involve a family member."
taurus,20210419,"You're up in someone's face thanks to an argument that could turn into something really big. You're filled with righteous fury, and you should be able to attract others to your cause."
taurus,20210420,You have to be patient with someone close today. Your tolerance can go a long way toward making them feel more comfortable and maybe willing to change.
taurus,20210421,"You need to gather your forces together and make sure that you're all marching in step. Things may be getting confused, but you can make sure that they get better with just a little effort."
taurus,20210422,"Your ability to get along well with others, even those who seem to dislike you, is heightened now, so you may want to forge new alliances or set aside old differences. It's easy!"
taurus,20210423,You need to take it easy if you can. Things are all going your way even if you can't see all the secret machinations that are conspiring to serve you. Relax and let the universe guide you to the right spot.
taurus,20210424,"Your desire for things may be sated today, but it could be that you still feel a need of some kind. It's a great time to fill it with spiritual pursuits or something else that's less focused on the material world."
taurus,20210425,It's a great time to kick back and relax. Just take it easy and put off anything strenuous for at least a few more days so you can recharge your batteries.
taurus,20210426,"Your interest in cultural material is heightened today, so explore different ways of seeing the world, and try to draw your family into your pursuit. Things should flow naturally from there."
taurus,20210427,"Your moods are deep in the mud today, but that can be incredibly fruitful! Let yourself wallow until you know what needs to happen next. You should be golden in just a few more days."
taurus,20210428,"You might get a little intense in a rivalry today, but not so much that you need to start a fight! Just make sure that you're clear about what's rightfully yours and all should end up where you want it."
taurus,20210429,"This isn't a good time to play fast and loose. Your luck is ebbing somewhat. That's not such a bad thing, though! Just hang back and try to deal with things as best you can."
taurus,20210430,It's a quieter period than you may have hoped for as a plan falls through or something else goes wrong in a small way. Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with a little unexpected downtime.
taurus,20210501,Today is perfect for trying out new points of view. Your great energy means it feels less risky to step into someone else's shoes and wander around in their world. See what happens!
taurus,20210502,"Your deep understanding of today's big problem makes you look like a prophet, so make the most of it! Try to get others to see that your view is the right one. It shouldn't be too hard."
taurus,20210503,"You just have to shake your head or roll your eyes when the weirdness comes. It's not that people are genuinely different, just that they want attention and will do anything to get it."
taurus,20210504,"Your conservative nature is on display today, and you might find that you need to tell some kids to get off your lawn (or colleagues to get off your turf, as the case may be). Let your inner curmudgeon out for a bit."
taurus,20210505,"Try not to spend too much time all by yourself today. Things are sure to get better soon, but only if you can find some new way to collaborate or at least hang out with like-minded people."
taurus,20210506,"You finally understand that friend or family member who has been acting so strangely of late. You may find that you're better off keeping your knowledge hidden for now, so watch and wait."
taurus,20210507,"You may think you've landed an awesome deal, but take your time before getting out that credit card. You're not quite in the right spot to make that kind of decision, so give it another day or two."
taurus,20210508,"You've got more options than you realize, so make sure that you're thinking through every step of the way. Explore new territory and you're sure to find the right match, though it takes time."
taurus,20210509,"You need to indulge yourself today even if you feel tapped out. In fact, a little decadence can go a long way toward recharging your batteries, so don't feel guilty about it!"
taurus,20210510,Your affection for a close friend or family member is improving your life today. You should double down and let them know how happy you are that they're part of your life.
taurus,20210511,"It's easy to laugh today, especially because the universe seems to be dreaming up new ways to entertain you! Push yourself to try new things and ask big questions. The answers are sure to amuse you."
taurus,20210512,"Try not to get entangled in anything involving regulations, lawyers, or anything else that might tie you down with rules. Your job is to ensure that you're free to do as you wish as much as is possible."
taurus,20210513,"Now is a good time for you to speak out. Your heart is as clear as ever, and you're sure to make your feelings known if you can find the courage to get started. At least one person is glad about your openness."
taurus,20210514,"Your communication skills are extra sharp today, so keep the lines open for anyone who needs them. In fact, you should go out of your way to reach out to those you miss."
taurus,20210515,"Can you spend all day puttering around the house? That might be ideal, but it might also be impossible. Try to clear some time to just take care of chores or paperwork. You should feel better."
taurus,20210516,"You are zeroing in on something that has been eluding you for a long time, even years. Use this new intuition to get closer to someone you love or to solve an old, nagging problem."
taurus,20210517,"You're caught up in a squabble at work or home that may cause more grief to the victor than the apparent loser. If you can disentangle yourself, that would be for the best."
taurus,20210518,"Let others speak their piece. You need to avoid coming across as preachy or someone who doesn't listen. You can still do things your way, but try harder to accommodate their positions if you can."
taurus,20210519,"You need to spend more time with people, and your good energy makes you great to have around! It's easier than ever to meet new friends or find new activities, so get out there and explore!"
taurus,20210520,"Enjoy some culture today. Music, art, movies, fiction, or whatever floats your boat. Your great energy is perfect for absorbing it, and it's way past time to get started!"
taurus,20210521,"Someone is courting you. It could be romantic, professional, or just someone who wants to be friends. Your amazing energy makes you even more attractive than usual, so don't be too surprised."
taurus,20210522,Pay close attention to your health today. You don't want to get sick or out of shape. Your energy is perfectly focused on your mind and body.
taurus,20210523,"If you want to recommit yourself to eating right or exercising regularly (and that's a great idea), you should find a buddy. It's always easier to keep it up when someone else is watching out for you."
taurus,20210524,"You need to deal with some intense new emotional state, which could be negative or positive. In either case, it has quite an impact on your life, so make sure that you're on top of it."
taurus,20210525,"Whatever you're feeling today is twice as intense as usual, so you may want to postpone that dental appointment! Of course, if you're happy, now is the time to double down on whatever it is that's lifted you up."
taurus,20210526,"You've got a lot going on in your head today, so much so that it may get kind of confusing! Try not to read too much into the frenzy of ideas, as this is just your mind defragging itself."
taurus,20210527,"Your philosophical notions are making life a little sweeter today, so make sure to spend extra time pondering life's mysteries. You may actually stumble on something practical!"
taurus,20210528,"Your ties to the natural world are enhanced today, so make sure that you're getting out there and breathing fresh air or experiencing the rain on your face. It feels great to be alive!"
taurus,20210529,"You are emotionally centered today, so much so that you may finally decide to confront that one friend or family member over their recent behavior. Things may heat up quite a bit!"
taurus,20210530,It's almost impossible to avoid getting caught up in today's big struggles. You may find that you need to show support for one party or that an unexpected player moves in on your territory!
taurus,20210531,"A radical new idea is sweeping through the workplace or has taken over a good friend of yours, and you might be the only person who can set things straight. Expect an uphill struggle."
taurus,20210601,"A friend comes to you with a deal or a suggestion and you should listen carefully! It's better than it appears at first glance, but that takes some effort to discern. Your open-mindedness is rewarded."
taurus,20210602,"You've got one big problem that you can't solve on your own. Now is the time to hit up a friend and at least get them to listen to you. They may not have the solution, but they know who can help."
taurus,20210603,"Your financial situation is taking over today, but that could be a good thing! Your energy is a bit off, but you can see a few solutions to advanced problems that should make life better."
taurus,20210604,"Take your time and make sure that you're thinking through all of your options. You are almost certainly on the precipice of something big, but you need to be sure you're making the right call."
taurus,20210605,"You are feeling better than ever right now, so it's a great time to push yourself in a new direction. That could mean that you're destined for something bigger and better or that you need to clean the basement."
taurus,20210606,"You've got some seriously intense feelings about someone new, but you're still just as balanced and together as usual! It's a really good day for you to step up and say something honest."
taurus,20210607,"You can easily get along with people today, even those who may not usually fit into your typical profile. Just make sure that you're listening to them as much as you're telling them what's what."
taurus,20210608,"You aren't quite feeling like yourself today, so make sure that you're checking your head before making any big decisions. Better still, try to put off those choices for another day or week."
taurus,20210609,"You're getting too far ahead of yourself, which could mean that you have to go back and repeat today's activities to get them done right. Try to pace yourself and follow along with wise friends."
taurus,20210610,"Try to speak from the heart today, as hard as that may seem at first. Your energy is better for emotional stuff than it is for practical business, and you could find that things start looking up later on."
taurus,20210611,"Spend time with friends or colleagues. You need to bond over a shared meal if you can. It's an ancient form of communion, and you may find yourself reconnecting with deeper relationships."
taurus,20210612,"Your good energy spills over into your mood and lifts you up, at least a bit. No matter what's going on today, part of you feels cozy and happy, so cling to that if events start to get weird."
taurus,20210613,"You and a friend are butting heads, though the argument may look ridiculous to those on the outside. They don't see all the hidden factors at play, but you still may have to back down eventually."
taurus,20210614,This is not a good time to deal with people who don't understand you. It's way too easy for you to fall back on rhetoric and turn them off with what may be seen as condescension.
taurus,20210615,"You're having a great time at work or with friends today. Your energy just seems to be in sync with your surroundings. Enjoy your time wherever you are, and try to lift up those who need a boost."

taurus,20210617,"Share your feelings with a friend or family member. Your affection is almost palpable, but you still need to speak from the heart. Your great personal energy helps you express yourself clearly."
taurus,20210618,"Dive into your daily routines. They don't feel boring in any way. That makes it the perfect day to take care of all the little tasks that have piled up, because it's practically impossible to lose focus."
taurus,20210619,Something small pops up as a distraction that makes the day seem to brighten considerably. You should actually find yourself getting more done as a result! Enjoy the good vibe.
taurus,20210620,"You feel differently about a person or ideal today, quite a bit differently! Your new intensity may lead to some crazy shenanigans, or it could just be your way of redrawing the map."
taurus,20210621,"A new emotional state wells up within you from somewhere really deep! It could be romantic or it could be something more spiritual. In any case, take it seriously and follow its lead."
taurus,20210622,Your passionate nature is making life a new adventure for you and those around you! You may be taking a romantic stand or maybe you're getting more politically involved.
taurus,20210623,"Your mind is concerned with security and the future, so it may be a good time to reconsider your financial situation. Look into retirement or investment options to put your mind at ease."
taurus,20210624,"This is not a good time to take risks. In fact, you should probably play it as safe as you can, or you may find that you start to drift backward financially or in other ways. Let others take the heat!"
taurus,20210625,"You need to indulge your earthy side, so eat hearty foods, get out in nature, and do whatever it takes to reconnect with your animal nature. It's fun and it should liberate your energy."
taurus,20210626,"You feel more connected to your people today, and it's easier than ever before to have difficult discussions when they're needed. Make sure that you're pushing for new things in your relationships."
taurus,20210627,"Your office or circle of friends is going through a power struggle today, so make sure that you're either backing the winner or staying out of the fray. You should be able to come out ahead."
taurus,20210628,"It's one of those days when you just can't stand disruption, and everything seems disruptive! Try not to step on anyone's toes, but it is likely difficult for you to stay quiet today."
taurus,20210629,It's not a great day for flying solo. Try to get a friend or colleague to back you up no matter what you've got going on. Your efforts are multiplied when you work as part of a team.
taurus,20210630,"A deeper understanding passes between you and a friend, co-worker, or loved one. This is a great time for you both to work together to strengthen your bond and build a better future."
taurus,20210701,"This is a bad day to make purchases. Try to wait until tomorrow or even later if possible. It may be that something newer and better comes your way, or maybe your finances need attention."
taurus,20210702,Take your time and look through every last option today. Even the tiniest details can be quite important to you. There's no need to make a snap decision even if a friend or colleague is breathing down your neck.
taurus,20210703,"Your arty side is fully engaged today, so head out to a gallery or drag out your art supplies and get creative! It's a good time for you to explore parts of yourself that you don't think about very often."
taurus,20210704,"Your loyalty is rarely questioned -- and on days like today, it's easy to see why. You step up to help someone you care about, even though they may have dismissed you quite recently."
taurus,20210705,"One distraction follows another, and soon you've started wasting more time than you can afford. There's not much to be done about it unless you've got an iron will -- and that's a rare commodity these days."
taurus,20210706,"Don't sign anything related to finance or money today unless there's simply no alternative. It's not that you're sure to take a loss, but waiting a few days makes your energy more auspicious."
taurus,20210707,"Contracts and other legal agreements need to simmer for another day or so before you're ready to sign off. That may take some delicate negotiations, but you can stall for as long as you need."
taurus,20210708,This is the best time for your love life to get some attention -- especially if you're single! You may find that the people you deal with day to day suddenly seem much more interesting.
taurus,20210709,"You can't keep these feelings bottled up for much longer -- so make sure that you're speaking out! It may take more courage than you think you've got, but your energy is just right for it."
taurus,20210710,Your closest allies are in disarray -- but you can bring them back together if you focus your energy. It's one of those days when you might spend more time on the phone than actually getting things done.
taurus,20210711,"The situation is out of balance -- you need an outside arbiter to set things right, or at least to make sure that nobody is taking advantage of the other. That may take a long time, so prepare and be patient."
taurus,20210712,You need to attach yourself to something or someone new -- and your energy is just right for reaching out and connecting. Things are sure to get more interesting in the near future.
taurus,20210713,Your sentimental side is engaged with the world today -- so make sure that you're showing your attachment to those you care about most. Your great energy makes you a joy to behold.
taurus,20210714,Your emotions are running away with you -- but make sure that they're not the only force acting on your life. It's a good time for you to see about new outlets for this kind of energy.
taurus,20210715,A small warning sets you off on a health-related panic today -- but you're actually a lot better off than you think! It's a good time for you to just chill out and take better care of yourself.
taurus,20210716,Now is the perfect time to start on a new project related to self-improvement -- especially if it's health-related. Go to the gym or buy a juicer or do whatever else you think might work out.
taurus,20210717,"You're clinging just a bit too tightly to someone or something that's not right for you. Try letting go just for a moment to see what happens. After the initial whirl of emotion, you should find yourself calmer."
taurus,20210718,"Today is about your relationships with your family and close friends. You don't necessarily need to do anything, but you should observe your reactions to them and ponder how you really feel."
taurus,20210719,You're feeling a sense of social well-being that may boost your spirits and your confidence. Expect a call from out of the blue as someone you've been thinking about lets you know it's mutual.
taurus,20210720,Your radar is set to ping at the slightest hint of offense today -- so try to keep that in mind when you're tempted to blow up! You should find that someone close is actually on your side.
taurus,20210721,"Your subconscious mind is acting out today -- which could mean you're seeing fairies or gremlins, or maybe just that your hunches are coming on stronger than ever before. Have fun!"
taurus,20210722,"Someone new blows into your life and shakes things up for the better. They have the zeal of a missionary, though their cause may be far from spiritual. It should be a positive relationship."
taurus,20210723,"Your ideals are tested today -- but your great energy ensures that you find the right way to deal with this. Make sure that you ask the right questions, even if the answers are far from forthcoming."
taurus,20210724,"You need to mix it up at work or in the neighborhood -- wherever a power struggle is looming. You don't necessarily need to take over, but you should throw your weight behind a winner."
taurus,20210725,"You feel a sense of urgency that might almost creep into desperation -- and it's all about change. Somehow, your social group is moving in a direction you don't like. Slam on the brakes!"
taurus,20210726,"Someone close is getting even closer -- in fact, you may find that they've got the same ideas you do before you even say them out loud. It's a good day for you to cement that friendship."
taurus,20210727,"You feel incredibly advanced today -- something just feels right to you, and there's no way for you to explain it to others who might still be stuck in old ways of thinking. They will catch up!"
taurus,20210728,The day seems to be moving along a lot faster than you are -- but don't panic! You just need to make sure that you're taking care of your own business in the way that best suits your needs.
taurus,20210729,You're taking your own sweet time with issues that are of importance to many people -- but that's just how it has to be. You may catch some flak for blowing a deadline but you'd rather get it done right.
taurus,20210730,"You're feeling better than you have in quite a while -- and not just because you pulled the perfect prank! Your energy is just in sync with the universe, so it's easier to get things done right."
taurus,20210731,"Intensity looks good on you! It turns out that one of your passions is vitally important today, so you may find that people turn to you for inspiration and motivation. It's easy to deliver!"
taurus,20210801,"Your interpersonal relations are smoother than ever today. If you need to settle an old feud, now is the time to hold out the olive branch. Others are sure that you've got what it takes."
taurus,20210802,"You're not quite yourself today, and you may feel a bit anxious as a result. Don't fret! You're actually entering a time of transition, and things are sure to get better quite soon."
taurus,20210803,You're way out ahead of the pack -- but try not to get too far out there! You should be able to get quite a lot done without abandoning your friends or colleagues. Pick a good pace.
taurus,20210804,"You are much more open today -- both your heart and your mouth! Try to communicate with the most important people in your life about the things that really matter, or this energy could go to waste."
taurus,20210805,"It's a great day for lunch meetings, dinner dates and any other social events involving food or beverages. Somehow the shared experience brings you much closer together. Work it!"

taurus,20210807,"Try to adopt an air of humility today -- even if you couldn't be prouder of your accomplishments. Things are looking up, but people are watching out for signs of ego. Just let it play out."
taurus,20210808,Your confidence may come across as something entirely different -- and maybe more troubling -- today. Bend over backwards to listen to what other people have to say about the situation.

taurus,20210813,"Today is all about you! (Well, and also a little about the United States Treasury.) You need to spend some of the day on your own issues, even if it's packed with other activities. Make the time."
taurus,20210814,"An intense wave of longing or happiness comes over you today, and you should feel drawn to someone or something new. It's not the most comfortable feeling, but it is a step in the right direction nonetheless."

taurus,20210825,Try not to spend too much money today -- you've got better ways to handle stress than retail therapy. You've got to try something new and maybe a bit uncomfortable to get ahead.
taurus,20210826,"You'd better shop around -- there are better deals waiting for you if you take the time to think through your options. It's easier than usual to go without, so you may just want to forgo this purchase entirely."

taurus,20210903,"You need to avoid the appearance of arrogance -- or any kind of egotism, really. It's not that you've got a problem, just that those around you are especially sensitive to those who seem full of themselves."

taurus,20210912,You need to advance your social life a bit today -- and it's not that hard. Your energy is right for meeting people halfway and really understanding their points of view. Sharing is caring!
taurus,20210913,This may not be the best day to get involved in big deals or decisions. It's not that you don't know what you want -- it's just that what you see may not reflect objective reality until tomorrow.
taurus,20210914,"Try to reconnect with your natural self -- get out in nature, if possible, or at least wander around outside to take in some fresh air. Your energy is amazing, but it needs the right context to come alive."

taurus,20210929,"You've been waiting for a response -- and it should come today. The odds are good that you like what you hear, so if you feel disappointed, think things through a bit before settling on a response of your own."

taurus,20220101,"If it feels a little like you're going crazy early today, take heart. It's just your subconscious acting out a bit. Pay attention to weird feelings and wild daydreams because they all hold clues."
gemini,20210101,"You are surrounded by the right people today, so make the most of their talents and create something wonderful! Your energy is terrific, and you should be able to get people to work together."
gemini,20210102,"Your big ideas need to be put to work today, so roll up those sleeves and get on it! You shouldn't find it hard to make progress, and you should be able to find others to help out."
gemini,20210103,"Try to figure out exactly what needs to happen today before you get started. It's sure to pay off. This may not be your usual way of doing things, but the day's energy will reward planning in a major way."
gemini,20210104,"The chatter is hard to cut through today, so don't bother trying! You need to just work with what you've got and make sure that you're paying attention to any signals that are repeated in the noise."
gemini,20210105,"Your energy level is through the roof today, and that could make you feel as giddy as a teenager with a new driver's license. Try not to take any risks, though, or you could feel like a teenager with a new speeding ticket!"
gemini,20210106,"Your energy is focused on someone close: a romantic partner, colleague or maybe dear friend. You can be pretty intense sometimes, but today's energy is all positive, so it should work out great."
gemini,20210107,"Today is all about watching and waiting and taking notes. You may feel impatient with the pace of the day's events, but you should be able to see where things are heading with ease."
gemini,20210108,"What's the biggest mystery in your life? Now is the time to tackle it head-on. You might find that your energy is primed for adventure, but only take on as much as you know you can handle."
gemini,20210109,"You and your closest friend or romantic partner need to talk today, and you should be on the same page! It's a good time to reconnect or even to take your relationship to a new level."
gemini,20210110,"You and a colleague or client are seeing things eye to eye, maybe for the first time in a while. You should try to get them to deal with whatever problem has been plaguing you both the longest."
gemini,20210111,You're not so sure what's really going on today. There are too many conflicting stories and threads to sort through easily. You may find that your best strategy is to take a pass on important business for now.
gemini,20210112,"You need to hide your true intentions a bit today, but it's not that hard. Lots of people are only interested in what's obvious, so you shouldn't have to actually lie in order to get your way."
gemini,20210113,"You can't just think things through today. Action is the only real way to learn things. You have a leg up on other people, though, as you find it easier than usual to try new activities."
gemini,20210114,"Someone really different appears in your life, maybe from a foreign country or maybe with just a vastly different mindset. You've got to deal with it, but see it as an opportunity."
gemini,20210115,"Your opinions shift as much as your moods today, which is to say quite a lot! It's good to be so flexible, but you may need to keep your people fully informed so they can make good decisions."
gemini,20210116,"You have to deal with one person too many today, which sounds ridiculous, but it can happen. Your social energy is somewhat limited now, so make sure that you focus on your VIPs."
gemini,20210117,"You're the master of communication, but today is all about subtle hints and signals, so it could be hard for you to make yourself understood. Try to speak as slowly and clearly as possible."
gemini,20210118,"Listen to your people today. They know better! At least one of them has the perfect advice for you, so if folks start to disagree, try to get them to hash it out among themselves."
gemini,20210119,A friend you don't see all that often might have a request or maybe a tip! Listen closely. This person could turn out to be really important in the near future.
gemini,20210120,"You're running out of steam in some way, so make sure that you're pushing back against limitations if at all possible. It's a good time to get help or to pare back your to-do list."
gemini,20210121,"Today is all about secrets. Can you count on yourself to not spill the beans? It's one of those days when you may be better off avoiding the people who need to be kept in the dark, but how long can that last?"
gemini,20210122,"You need to sit down and talk things over with friends or family. It's not like it's the end of the world, far from it, but you've got the right kind of energy to bring people together in a new way."
gemini,20210123,"You've got brainy energy to spare, so make the most of it! You should be able to solve problems or see new ones that no one else has yet identified. Whatever you do, have fun with it!"
gemini,20210124,"You're extra busy right now, but that isn't a bad thing. You might have to choose a few activities to de-prioritize, but stick with the stuff that's interesting and you can't go wrong."
gemini,20210125,"Start something new, or at least restart something that needs some new energy. Your initiative is key to the day's success, so pick something that fires you up and get going!"
gemini,20210126,"You can get away with some extra downtime today. It's not selfish! If anything, you're powering yourself up to help out some friends in need who just haven't asked you for assistance yet."
gemini,20210127,"Your brain is full of great ideas today, so start talking and don't stop until you've convinced the world of your brilliance! It's a good time to make suggestions at work or at home."
gemini,20210128,"Of course you've got opinions. Who doesn't? Today's brilliant energy gives you the debating skills to make your case and then some, so see if you can get your allies to stand firm behind you."
gemini,20210129,"Your mental energy is terrific right now, so you should be able to power through all sorts of brainy projects. You might have a few great ideas that can really take you places."
gemini,20210130,It's harder than usual for you to make yourself understood. Even your closest family members shake their heads in wonder. It's a good time to keep your cards close to your vest.
gemini,20210131,"Social cues are harder to deal with than usual, and for a person like you, that could mean disaster! Try to avoid any tricky or delicate situations and see if you can ride past this phase."
gemini,20210201,"You're having even more fun than usual, and for you, that's saying quite a lot! It's easy to get others to enjoy themselves even if they're dead set on sticking to their grumpy mood."
gemini,20210202,"Your brainy energy is re-engaged with an old problem, so make the most of it and speed toward a solution. You might find it easier to brainstorm with others who share your interest."
gemini,20210203,Engage in some serious service to people or larger causes today. You've got the time and energy; you just need the motivation! Now is a really good time for you to embrace your idealism.
gemini,20210204,"Explore your health today, unless you're having a specific problem, in which case get on top of it as soon as you can! Your mind is well equipped to handle such matters now."
gemini,20210205,"Your emotional side is really wild today, and you need to make sure that you're paying attention! It's a good time for you to ask yourself what you really want and how you can get it."
gemini,20210206,You and a friend or business partner are working well together. Your energies are in perfect sync! Now is a good time to move forward on big joint projects or to start new things together.
gemini,20210207,"You have to step up and take direct action. Your people are too confused to make the first move. Once you lead the way, they should see what needs to happen and then make it so."
gemini,20210208,"Everything you do today feels about one notch harder than it should be, but don't give up! You need to keep pushing and try to get your people to back you up when the going gets tough."
gemini,20210209,"It's harder than usual for you to cope with other people's interference today, so do what you can to avoid unnecessary socializing. This is temporary. You should be back in business by tomorrow!"
gemini,20210210,Your sparkling intellect is making those around you smile despite themselves. You toss off bon mots and great ideas as if you were flipping pennies into a wishing well. Enjoy the ride!
gemini,20210211,"You may get caught up in a new passion, possibly related to a new interest of yours or maybe a cause that hasn't quite hit the mainstream yet. Things are looking up for you and your people!"
gemini,20210212,"Your working life is causing problems in the rest of your life, but you need to find a way to keep it all in balance. Somehow, you should be able to pull off this magic trick. Go for it!"
gemini,20210213,You may misunderstand something that seems like a big deal but turns out to be more of a tempest in a teapot. Try to be skeptical of your urge to panic. Things are not as bad as they may seem.
gemini,20210214,"You've got to listen carefully when people tell you what's really going on. They're close to right, but you've got to fill in some blanks before you can be sure you know what to do next."
gemini,20210215,"Your people are looking to you for advice, and even folks who barely know you are paying close attention. It's a good time for you to step up and make some positive changes in people's lives."
gemini,20210216,"You are running up against obstacles today, possibly too many to handle. Now is a good time for you to enlist support and see about getting friends or colleagues to come to the rescue."
gemini,20210217,"Patience is not one of your primary virtues, but don't worry. You've got others! Today, though, you need to wait for something or someone, and if you can do so gracefully, it's a win!"
gemini,20210218,This is not a good time for you to flit from person to person. You need to focus your energy on someone important. That could mean that you're in a good space for relationship work.
gemini,20210219,"Try not to worry about the future. Today's good times and good energy are all that really matter. Things are looking up, but you are almost certain to leave some loose threads for later days."
gemini,20210220,"Your fantastic energy needs an outlet, preferably several of them. Get on the wire and find some like minds who can help you as you start on a terrific new project. Things can get really exciting!"
gemini,20210221,"Your ability to work magic with numbers is enhanced today, which could mean that it's a good time to look at your budget or retirement accounts. Your mental state isn't exactly creative, but it is flexible."
gemini,20210222,"This is not a good time to shop or buy gifts. You're feeling really tight with money, and that's not exactly conducive to thoughtful purchasing. Put it off for a few days if possible."
gemini,20210223,"Now is a great time to focus on crafting, home brewing, or other fun activities that can also save you some money. Even if you feel flush, it's better to sock away the excess than fritter it on unnecessary purchases."
gemini,20210224,"You've got an opinion on any given topic, and your mental energy keeps you from making people feel funny about their own ideas. It's a good time to discuss big plans and rethink old ideas."
gemini,20210225,"Your idea of fun is debating hot topics and trying to get deep inside the minds of those who disagree with you. It's all a good time to you, but at least one other person may not feel that way."
gemini,20210226,"You need to get some straight talk from a good friend or close colleague. Their advice can make the difference between spinning your wheels and racing over the finish line, so listen up."
gemini,20210227,"Do you have a stack of bills or paperwork? Now is the time to clear it out. You may have forgotten something, and it's best to handle it before it's too late. Make a to-do list!"
gemini,20210228,"Someone is poking their nose into your business, and it's kind of hard for you to tell them gently to buzz off. You may need to be rude, but don't feel bad. They brought it on themselves!"
gemini,20210301,"Your great energy is smoothing out any recent rough edges. You should feel much better by the end of the day! If things have been bad, now they're better, and if they've been good, you're on top of the world!"
gemini,20210302,"Your energy level is unbelievably high right now, so see if you can turn it to your advantage in some new way. It could be that you need to start talking to that new person at work or in the neighborhood."
gemini,20210303,You've got to investigate today's mystery more closely. Something really weird is happening right under your nose! It's a good time for you to look into things that seem unknowable.
gemini,20210304,"It's a better day for observation than for action. You need to make sure that you've got all the facts before you take on anything new, and that could mean waiting for quite a while."
gemini,20210305,"Your relationships are important today, so give them the attention they deserve. It's a good day for heartfelt talks and important decisions, so take a deep breath and plunge in!"
gemini,20210306,"You and a friend or colleague are perfectly matched today, so work together if you can. It's a really good time for you to make serious progress on something involving teamwork."
gemini,20210307,"Confusion reigns today, so embrace it! There's no need to be clear when communicating because it won't do much good anyway. If you don't understand something, file it away for later."
gemini,20210308,"You aren't quite sure what to make of that friend or family member who seems to be keeping secrets from you. It's a good time to just watch and wait, because a lead is sure to open up soon."
gemini,20210309,"Someone really different could show up today, maybe a wild card at work or a new dating profile that blows you away. Whatever it is, follow it up. Things are about to change for the better!"
gemini,20210310,"Your opinions aren't so deeply held that you need to fight back when they're questioned. In fact, on a day like today, your potent mental energy helps you to change your mind if the facts warrant it."
gemini,20210311,"You've got too much going on today, so see if you can cut some stuff out of your busy schedule at some point. It shouldn't be too hard to accommodate the most important people."
gemini,20210312,"You have to be as clear as you can be. It's not easy, but the good news is that this foggy phase should only last another day or so. All should make sense by tomorrow, and then you can act."
gemini,20210313,Listen carefully when friends come to you with words of wisdom or even just mindless babble. You can squeeze good advice out of almost anything on a day like today. Enjoy the results!
gemini,20210314,"Your distant contacts are making life more interesting, so pay more attention to those on her fringes than those you see every day. Life can get even better as long as you keep your people together."
gemini,20210315,"Your deepest desires are on the surface today, so make sure that you're listening to what you're really saying, It could be time for a bold change, which could make life a lot better!"
gemini,20210316,"You're feeling a bit cautious about today's main event, and with good reason! You need to take a step back and make sure that you're not pushing yourself too hard. It's easy to see how to change."
gemini,20210317,"You're entrusted with a secret that may be too much to take, at least for now. Still, you need to keep it. Your best bet might be to keep your mouth shut for the rest of the day, or even go home early."
gemini,20210318,"You need to open up a new discussion today. Your people are looking to you for leadership, and your great energy helps you to do just that. Conversation opens up all sorts of new avenues."
gemini,20210319,"Your brainpower is ten times greater than usual today, so make the most of it! You might find that others are intimidated at first, but you can show them that there's nothing to be afraid of."
gemini,20210320,You're as busy as can be today and you love it! Your energy is just right for getting what you want and running with it further than ever before. Hit that milestone and keep going!
gemini,20210321,
gemini,20210322,"Get started on something new today. You may not be in the mood for excitement, but your initiative is a powerful force nonetheless. Indulge a friend who wants to be a big player."
gemini,20210323,"People could take your witticisms entirely too seriously today, so be at least partially aware of feelings and responses. It's a good day for building relationships, if you can."
gemini,20210324,"You're finding it so much easier to deal with folks that you may suspect they've been replaced by pod people. Not to worry! They just came around, so keep pushing!"
gemini,20210325,"It's a good day to put your big ideas into action, so make sure that you keep busy all day long! Your amazing energy is just right for productivity and entrepreneurship. Great things are possible!"
gemini,20210326,
gemini,20210327,"Idle chatter is a real risk today, so focus on what's most important. Your social energy may need to be kept on a tight leash, but that's not such a bad problem to have."
gemini,20210328,"You need to focus on your business or romantic partner, possibly to the exclusion of all else. If that's not possible, at least let them know that you're taking their concerns seriously today."
gemini,20210329,"Your mental energy is fantastic, but it may lead you in two very different directions. It's not a good time for you to try to focus, but it's a terrific day for a brainstorming session!"
gemini,20210330,"It's a slow day, and not just for you! Lots of folks around you seem to be taking their time processing information and waiting to see what others do before taking action or voicing opinions."
gemini,20210331,"Your spunk is making itself known today, and you should find that it's easier than ever to resist pressure from outside forces. In fact, you could pressure them right back and get your own way!"
gemini,20210401,"You have to take quick action today, but you've got exactly the right kind of energy to do just that. It's easier than ever for you to build on your accomplishments and make things happen."
gemini,20210402,"Take things to the next level. You've got some seriously good ideas, but you can't make anything of them if you don't move quickly. A good friend or colleague can help you take it all the way home."
gemini,20210403,"You're feeling held back today, but it's all external. If you can focus entirely on your personal issues or projects, you should be able to make decent progress. Collaboration is not advised."
gemini,20210404,"Your closest friend or colleague, or possibly your partner, turns into a control freak for the day. That's no fun, but you might be able to placate them until things return to normal."
gemini,20210405,"Your big brain is making waves today in the best way possible! All that great energy should help you convince others that your ideas are worth pursuing, so speak with confidence."
gemini,20210406,"Your big ideals make life more interesting, and that could mean that you've got some new opportunities coming your way. Make sure you've got time for everyone involved. It could mean overtime."
gemini,20210407,"Your career gets a boost today, possibly pretty late. Your energy is a bit scattered, but you can still focus on making things happen at work or in your job search. Make the most of this!"
gemini,20210408,"A small misunderstanding could turn into a major flare-up if you don't suppress it in time. Make sure you're paying attention to what others are saying, and try to reflect it back to them to see if you're right."
gemini,20210409,"Change is good, but only you seem to know that today. Try to get others to embrace the new rules or design or whatever has changed lately, but don't expect much progress for at least a few more days."
gemini,20210410,"Try to push things forward today. Your fire can help drive this latest project even if no one else seems interested. You're sure to pick up momentum as you move forward, so keep it up!"
gemini,20210411,"Communication is your area of expertise, and today your energy makes every word sound just right to the person it's meant for. Make the most of this now. Soon you'll pop back into normal mode."
gemini,20210412,"Your attention to little things like bills and errands may have lapsed, but now is the time to get back on track. You should be able to get your people to give you the time you need."
gemini,20210413,"You're still in the right frame of mind to attend to business matters and other stuff that can't be delayed. Serious issues won't go away on their own, so you might as well tackle them while you can."
gemini,20210414,"Try to move through your day quickly and simply. Things are moving freely and may keep you busier than you'd expect. You feel great, and you should be able to start lots of things other folks can finish."
gemini,20210415,"Your communication skills are never in question, but you may find that they defy expectations today. You can express yourself with unusual clarity, and you could make a terrific impression on someone new."
gemini,20210416,"You are feeling pretty social today, and that means it's time to get out there and network (or just enjoy yourself). At least one important new person could cross your path today."
gemini,20210417,"You should get plenty done today, like a lot of other people, but your mood just doesn't seem to lift very high. Don't worry about it. Things should improve in just a few days."
gemini,20210418,"Your possessive side comes out, probably surprising a few people. It may have to do with a relationship, but it's more likely focused on a privilege or perk you've gotten used to."
gemini,20210419,You're having too much fun to worry about tomorrow or the next day. Your terrific social energy makes it easy to start up fun little arguments and watch people get all riled up.
gemini,20210420,"Go easy today. Things aren't really lined up correctly to deal with serious issues. That doesn't mean it's a bad day, just that you need to put the intense stuff on the back burner for a while."
gemini,20210421,People could take your jokes a little too seriously today. That shouldn't be a big deal as long as you can backtrack quickly if someone gets offended. Just apologize and move on.
gemini,20210422,A friend or colleague misunderstands you. That might lead to some dire consequences if you don't correct them as soon as you figure it out. Take care and all will be well.
gemini,20210423,Take the advice of friends and family today even if it's contradictory. You should find that life starts to sort itself out once you give yourself over to some guidance.
gemini,20210424,"You are thinking deeper thoughts than usual, so talk to a smart friend and bounce your new ideas off them. If you meet opposition, engage with it and see if you can find a compromise."
gemini,20210425,"It's time to get busy! You might run into some resistance from family or friends who want to stay put, but your boundless energy can't be denied. Engage with the wider world."
gemini,20210426,"Your romantic side is starting to heat up, and it's a really good time to either woo your partner all over again or start looking for someone if you're single. You can't go wrong!"
gemini,20210427,"Your brain is fully active today, and you may get clues from all around you. It's a good time to listen to your intuitive as well as rational side. Insights fuel growth!"
gemini,20210428,"It's better to watch than to be active today. Otherwise, you may find that things start to get out of hand. Your energy is best spent on absorbing information and thinking it over."
gemini,20210429,"Your brains are showing! A good idea slips out and impresses the heck out of your boss, teacher, or someone else you need approval from. Keep it up and you're sure to be a star!"
gemini,20210430,"Enjoy the good times. Things are going to get even better, so make sure that you're really making the most of it! Events should exceed all your expectations."
gemini,20210501,"It's time to reveal your hidden agenda for the next few months. This doesn't have to be a list of resolutions, more like promises or threats that you intend to make good on soon."
gemini,20210502,This isn't a good day for idle speculation. You need to jump into things feetfirst and make sure that you're pushing for action. You can only find out if things work by trying them out for real.
gemini,20210503,"You're feeling a change coming, and it could be in your own mind. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, you almost certainly need to shift your thinking to accommodate new information."
gemini,20210504,"You need to challenge your deepest ideas today, so close yourself off for a bit and turn that fierce intellect inward. Things should start to make a lot more sense by the end of the day."
gemini,20210505,"Take the time to think things through before asking for favors or trying to explain yourself. In fact, you may want to put that off for a few days. Communication is hampered a bit."
gemini,20210506,"You need to take care of some public relations issue that has slipped out of your control. The good news is that you've got the skills to handle it, but it could set you back in other areas."
gemini,20210507,"You have to listen up when your people start talking or you may not even notice when that hot advice comes your way! This is a tip you can't afford to miss, so pay attention."
gemini,20210508,"You've got friends who can help you with almost any problem you face, and their friends can take care of the rest. Just reach out if you're worried. Things should start to brighten soon."
gemini,20210509,"It's time to take care of basic business, the kind you'd rather leave to others. There's some paperwork that only you can do, so make sure that you're on the ball. Things should perk up in a few days."
gemini,20210510,"Someone needs some advice today, so make sure that you're dishing it out! You may not feel as energetic as usual, but if you can tap into your inner oracle, things should go well for you both."
gemini,20210511,Has a bill been hanging over your head lately? Now is the time to face up to that backlog and deal with your finances even if you don't feel like it. Things start to get better almost immediately!
gemini,20210512,"You're in the middle of a flurry of activity today, so much so that you may find it easier to let it move you rather than try to influence it directly. It's all good fun however it goes down."
gemini,20210513,"You're in constant motion today, so make sure that your people know what's what. Things may get a little hectic, but you are more than capable of adjusting to and even enjoying the process!"
gemini,20210514,"You could be feeling a bit moody today, especially if you're frustrated about a recent setback. You're better off just letting it wash over you and moving on, but if you have to wallow in it, go right ahead."
gemini,20210515,"Changes are less welcome today, but you may be able to cope if you get others to help you plan and prioritize. Soon you should be back in business and able to adapt with the best of them!"
gemini,20210516,"Your thinking is a bit muddled today, but maybe you can work that to your advantage! See if you can kick back and indulge in some creative brainstorming. Let your mind wander."
gemini,20210517,"You are feeling brainy and excited, and with good reason! Your intellectual energy is fully engaged, and you should find it simple to pick up answers to thorny questions. Indulge your mind!"
gemini,20210518,"You've got opinions that count for quite a bit today, but you may find that it's easier to lay them out all in one big plan than as individual details. Get some help organizing it all!"
gemini,20210519,"Try to check in with your people today. You need to deal with folks who have been quiet for a while. It's always good to maintain your relationships, but today offers a special kind of social conscience."
gemini,20210520,"You need to deal with the little errands and tasks that have piled up lately. Things are pretty good overall, but you may find it easier in the future if you handle all that stuff today."
gemini,20210521,"This isn't the best time for communication. You may feel as if you're talking to a brick wall. This is especially true with family, but it should ease up pretty soon."
gemini,20210522,"Your energy is boundless today, though you might be reluctant to use it as others want you to. Start lots of different threads and projects and let your people decide which ones they want to follow."

gemini,20210814,"Help someone out today -- even if they don't really deserve it. You still get something good back from the universe when you extend your energy out in new directions, and that is certainly worthwhile."
gemini,20210815,"How's your health? Today's energy gives you bonus insight into the workings of your body and mind, so it's the perfect time to decide on a new, healthier lifestyle or just to get a checkup."

gemini,20211126,"You don't usually waste time coolly calculating your odds of success. You just go ahead and try things out! Today, though, you need to think things through if you want to make any progress."

gemini,20220101,"It's too easy to slip into dogmatic thinking, but you need to avoid that tendency. It's way too easy to just go along with whatever worked in the past, but you have to be more flexible than that!"
cancer,20210101,"It's a good time to double-check your bank account or credit limit or you could purchase something that is far more than you can afford. Things should settle down soon, though."

cancer,20210104,"Try to clean up around the house or at work. You need a certain amount of order before you can make the most of your energy. Once you feel comfortable, it's time to dive in!"

cancer,20210804,"Your energy is off the charts today -- so do something terrific with it! You should find that you've got more time on your hands than usual, and that hard tasks seem much, much simpler."
cancer,20210805,It's all about you right now -- so pamper yourself a little! It's a good time for you to deal with any personal issues that you've been avoiding for whatever reason. You need a clean slate!
cancer,20210806,You are feeling quite extravagant today -- so make sure that you're dealing with your people generously! It may be that you accidentally give someone just what they need for bonus karma.
cancer,20210807,"Your impulsive side is making waves today, and you should find that you're in a very different place by the time night rolls in. Live it up and enjoy every minute of it. It's back to business soon."

cancer,20210809,"Communication is great today, so it's the best time for you to dive into complex negotiations or to try to express that odd set of feelings you've got for someone or something."
cancer,20210810,"Details are vital now. That could mean that you've got to go over that giant spreadsheet one last time, or it could mean that it's time to get into spring cleaning mode before the mildew takes over the house."
cancer,20210811,"You're spending a little extra time at home today -- at least in your heart. You may be stuck elsewhere, but you're also thinking about family and redecorating and spring cleaning all at once."
cancer,20210812,Expect trouble with family or roommates -- though it's nothing serious. You may just be at cross purposes regarding a financial decision or how often house cleaning ought to be done.
cancer,20210813,Some important deadline or request is much harder to realize than you want it to be. Call in the cavalry and see if you can make things happen with a little help from your friends. It's not as bad as you fear.
cancer,20210814,Your indecision isn't a problem -- it's actually a benefit today! You should find that people give you the room to hem and haw and keep absorbing new information while your intuition chews at the problem.

cancer,20210817,"Take good care of yourself -- it's a good time for further education or for positive steps toward a healthier lifestyle. Get some advice if you think you need it, but your intuition should be enough."
cancer,20210818,You feel somewhat more withdrawn today -- and there's nothing wrong with that! Sometimes you need to kick back on your own or with close family to let your emotional reserves fill back up.
cancer,20210819,"Some big issue is on your radar, and there's just no way you're going to be able to let go of it. You may as well give it your best, because if you can take care of it all at once, you can get back to important stuff."
cancer,20210820,"You need to deal with money today -- maybe just at work, or more likely as part of your daily life. It's one of those issues that never goes away, but your mindset is perfect for handling it."
cancer,20210821,You and your partner (romantic or otherwise) are at odds with each other today over something that seems silly at first glance but turns into a big deal the more you look at it. Try to see both sides.
cancer,20210822,"Your mind is wandering today -- but there's nothing wrong with that! You may find that you are in a good place at work or with home chores, so you've got the luxury of daydreaming."
cancer,20210823,"Your energy is diffuse today, but that doesn't mean you can't get stuff done. It's one of those days when your mind is likely to wander off into fertile territory, so come back with something good!"
cancer,20210824,"Try to avoid any minute details today -- your mental energy just isn't up for it right now. It's a good day for big-picture planning or strategy sessions, if they can be arranged."
cancer,20210825,"Your mental agility is quite impressive -- so make the most of it! Show off at work, make a good impression with a coffee date or just enjoy the fruits of heightened intelligence."
cancer,20210826,"Your mind is working like clockwork today, and your memory is especially powerful. You may recall some odd facts that haven't surfaced in years -- write them down for posterity!"
cancer,20210827,It's vital that you surround yourself with people today -- in one fashion or another. You may find it easier than usual to work as part of a team or to show others how it's done.
cancer,20210828,It's time for you to get started on something new. That could mean almost anything from a new romance to a job in another city. Your energy gives you the confidence you need to succeed.
cancer,20210829,Take a deeper look at the details of your latest deal or transaction -- you need to understand them better if you want to keep moving forward. Things are looking good if you stay alert.
cancer,20210830,It's vital that you keep your eyes focused on the shell game going on in front of you -- details are everything! You may find that you can get a better sense of what's what if you keep quiet.
cancer,20210831,"Try to assert your rights today -- especially at work or in other environments where you aren't in total control. All you have to do is speak up to be taken seriously, so it shouldn't be too tough."
cancer,20210901,"Can you feel your energy replenishing? That's happening behind the scenes, so you may not even realize until it's late and you're still puttering away at whatever project gives you the most pleasure."
cancer,20210902,"Your emotional well-being is quite important, and you should find that you're better able than ever before to keep it healthy. Make sure that you're checking in with all your people."
cancer,20210903,"Your social energy is pushing you to try something new and sassy -- and may involve showing off quite a bit! There's no shame in it, so indulge yourself and see where it all goes from here."
cancer,20210904,It's time to really shake things up -- in one way or another. You may find that your energy is better spent on some dramatic gesture or wild impulse purchase than on mundane tasks at home or work.
cancer,20210905,Communication is pretty great right now -- so it's the best time for you to make your case or try to convince a friend that they need to mend their ways soon. You have a better shot if you just go for it!
cancer,20210906,"You're entranced by some small details that seem to make life a little more special. Things are looking up for you and a friend, and something you catch in the fine print makes it even better."
cancer,20210907,"Your left brain is somewhat hyperactive today, so much so that you could find yourself rejecting emotional arguments without consideration. That's unlike you, but it can still be revealing."
cancer,20210908,"Try to take extra care today -- especially with new projects. Something small could grow into a major obstacle if it's not addressed immediately. Once you see it, you will know what to do."
cancer,20210909,"You've got to be wary of other people today -- not because they've got you in their sights, but just because they may have different agendas. If you're conscious of that, you should be fine."

cancer,20210911,Try to take greater care with business and negotiations today -- people are likely trying to get more than their fair share. You may find that you're better off waiting for a few days.
cancer,20210912,"Try taking care of yourself today -- even if you've got too much other stuff to do. If that's the case, you need to be at your best, and that can only happen if your basic needs are taken care of."
cancer,20210913,"Ignore other people's needs -- at least until your own are met. It may feel almost impossible, especially if you've got kids or ailing parents, but sometimes you need to do your own thing."
cancer,20210914,"Balance is everything now, so make sure that you're keeping all your activities well-regulated. Things may get a little weird by the end of the day, but you can handle anything."
cancer,20210915,"Today could be a 1 or a 10, but not likely anywhere in between those extremes. If things start to slip out of your control, that's your cue to exit and then see if you can ride it out somewhere comfy."
cancer,20210916,How's your cash flow? Today is perfect for making tweaks to your budget or for finding new ways to bring in money -- though some of them may stretch you beyond your comfort zone.
cancer,20210917,"Teamwork is fraught with peril -- but only if you try to paper over conflicts. Bring them out in the open and try to find common ground, or else your people will never get along."
cancer,20210918,Your emotions are making life a lot stranger today -- so make sure that you're dealing with them forcefully. Don't freak out if friends or coworkers feel like robots; they're just on a different wavelength.
cancer,20210919,"You're feeling quite close to someone today -- or maybe a whole group! Your great social energy is quite a spectacle, actually, so you should find that you draw others into your orbit."
cancer,20210920,"That hunch that creeps up on you today is worth quite a lot -- so make sure that you're ready to act on it. In fact, you may experience a sort of quantum leap in consciousness that shakes you up in a good way."
cancer,20210921,"An authority figure looms large today and may cause problems for you -- especially if you fight back. Even if you know you're right, hold off on conflict until a few more days have passed."
cancer,20210922,"Your big brain is a potent force -- so make sure that you're using it! It's one of those days when your people need guidance, and you can offer it quickly. Once you see the problem, you know what to do."
cancer,20210923,"You need to take charge today -- otherwise, things are going to spiral out of control in no time. The good news is that people are looking for leadership, so you ought to be able to slide into place."
cancer,20210924,You've got a strong sense that you need to get back home -- whatever that means to you -- and it's pushing you in the right direction. Domestic issues are of paramount importance to you now.
cancer,20210925,"Push yourself a little -- things aren't quite going your way at first, but if you can crawl out of your shell long enough to make an impression, things should improve dramatically."
cancer,20210926,You've got quite a lengthy to-do list staring you in the face -- but you can take care of all of it with ease. You just need to apply your energy to each one as it pops up and ignore all distractions.
cancer,20210927,Communication is a very big deal today -- but you may have problems with ambiguity. Have people repeat back to you what you said so you can correct them as necessary. It's easy and important.
cancer,20210928,"Today represents the beginning of something new, even as things draw to a close. It may be a relationship or a habit, but the new addition to your life should be for the best. Embrace it!"
cancer,20210929,"You need to trust your intuition -- it's pumping out clues and hunches almost as fast as you can absorb them! Even if it seems crazy, you should be able to make great progress."
cancer,20210930,"You are showing off today -- so flaunt it if you've got it! Heck, even if you don't you should still make it work as best you can. It's one of those days when everything clicks."
cancer,20211001,"You're tempted to spend more than you can afford -- and as long as it's really just this once, you should go for it. Extravagance doesn't work as a lifestyle choice, but it's fun every now and then."
cancer,20211002,"Inspiration strikes in a flash and you almost can't help but act on it. This kind of impulsive behavior is somewhat unlike you, but life is full of surprises. Enjoy the results and change your life!"
cancer,20211003,"Your social interactions are deeper and stronger than usual, so it's a great time for dates, getting to know new coworkers or just spending quality time with friends and family."
cancer,20211004,"Now is the time to write that letter, bring up that delicate topic or ask out that new hottie. Your social energy is great, and your ability to put feelings into words is stronger than it's ever been."
cancer,20211005,"You need to watch out for others who may not share your agenda. It's not like they're going to stab you in the back, but you may not have as much support as you thought you did."
cancer,20211006,A problem at home could interfere with your focus at work or at school. It may be time for you to head out and just focus on what's most important. Other aspects of life can wait for a while.
cancer,20211007,You're facing a family issue that can't be ignored. It may be life-changing or it could be as simple as a little spat -- but you've got to address it as soon as possible. Someone close needs your support.
cancer,20211008,"Try not to get too deeply involved with any people or projects that seem fishy to you -- that instinct is strong! If anything, you may want to avoid new folks altogether until your radar stops bleeping."
cancer,20211009,"Though your emotional energy is stronger than ever, you may still feel quite indecisive. It's not the best time for you to make big decisions anyway, so don't worry too much about how it plays out."
cancer,20211010,"You need to decide between focusing on your family and focusing on your social life today -- the two are unlikely to mix at all. The good news is that whichever way you face, you solve a problem of some importance."
cancer,20211011,"Your dedication to service is admirable, and right now you can see that someone or some cause is in dire need of your skills. Make sure that you're putting them to the best use possible!"
cancer,20211012,You may feel great today -- or you may feel like you're all the way on the other end of the spectrum. Try to move back toward some kind of balance and see if things can get better soon.
cancer,20211013,"You may feel more withdrawn and introverted than usual, especially early in the day. Don't read too much into it -- just try to ease into any social obligations that come your way."
cancer,20211014,You have got to display adaptability today -- even if you'd rather just slink home and crawl back under the covers. It's a good time to check into your newest issue and see if you can solve it quickly.
cancer,20211015,"Money is a problem today -- though it may not be a run-of-the-mill financial issue. In fact, you may have the enviable dilemma of how best to spend a windfall. Don't ignore it, whatever it is!"
cancer,20211016,You're feeling the urge to share your energy with those who need it -- from your hapless nephew to the local homeless community. Your power is most potent when it's directed outward.
cancer,20211017,"Though your energy is terrific, it may be hard to keep your mind from wandering. Things are sure to get a little better in the afternoon, but one odd diversion may take you in a great new direction."
cancer,20211018,"It's harder to deal with authority figures -- so maybe it's a good time to just hang back and chill out. Things are looking up, but it may take a few days for the clouds to lift. Patience is golden!"
cancer,20211019,"Your quick wit is helping you out in a big way -- maybe in a job interview, or maybe in catching out someone in a small lie. Try not to worry too much about the details, though."
cancer,20211020,"People are much more receptive to your ideas and plans today -- so speak up! Your energy is better spent on meetings than action, which is kind of rare. Make the most of it this time!"
cancer,20211021,"Try to get out there and mix it up today -- your social energy is craving company, and you should find that things just start to roll as soon as you mingle with the right crowd. Have fun!"
cancer,20211022,"It's a great day to host something fun for friends or colleagues. You're the perfect host, and your people are sure to have a great time. You may meet someone new who changes everything."
cancer,20211023,You've got quite a lengthy to-do list today. That shouldn't be daunting -- but it still may be too much to handle on your own. Seek out help and everything should be just fine by next week.
cancer,20211024,Things are moving so quickly today that it's way too easy for you or someone else to get hung up on a misunderstanding. Be wary of anything that seems too outrageous to be true -- it probably is.
cancer,20211025,"Something small is bugging you -- but it ends up being hugely beneficial! In fact, you may almost feel as if a spirit twin is guiding your actions as you glide past every obstacle."
cancer,20211026,"Personal business is vitally important right now, so make sure that you're focused on your own issues. Even if someone close needs you, it's a good idea to split your time to keep up momentum."
cancer,20211027,"You are moving up into something new and better -- so enjoy! It's a great time to ask for a raise, go for a travel upgrade or take a relationship to a new level. You totally deserve it."
cancer,20211028,"Spend as much as you need to -- things are better than you think. In fact, going cheap is almost certain to backfire today, because quality is of much higher importance than it usually is."
cancer,20211029,"Try not to make today's purchases based solely on price -- you've got to at least think about quality as well. You may not be ready for a colossal price tag, but you can surely compromise."
cancer,20211030,"Your left brain is working hard today -- so feed it with facts and hard, cold information. Your energy is better spent on problems that have yes-or-no answers, so put off the complex stuff for another day."
cancer,20211031,"Ignore the big picture for the time being -- you need to focus on the smaller stuff. Organize folders, make sure everything is where it needs to be and then you're set for what's coming up."
cancer,20211101,"It's a good idea to stick close to home today. It's certainly where the heart is. Try not to roam too far, though if you're traveling or otherwise stuck out in the world, make sure to reconnect early and often."
cancer,20211102,"Try to open up to that new person in your life at work, at home, or wherever. This could be the start of a great partnership, but it's certainly up to you to make the first move."
cancer,20211103,"Conflicting ideas could make life difficult for you and a close friend or colleague. Try not to read too much into it, but you almost certainly have to work through this before you can move on."
cancer,20211104,"Someone comes to you with a proposal that sounds too good to be true. Well, that could be because it is. But even if you're sure they're being honest, you still ought to decline or take time to think it through."
cancer,20211105,"You're just not sure what to make of this latest development, and that's okay! You don't have to know everything, and you should be able to get to the bottom of it some other day. Let it ride."
cancer,20211106,You have to take care of yourself today even if someone else feels like they could use your support more than you. It's one of those days that requires a bit of social finesse.
cancer,20211107,"It's harder than usual for you to get moving today. Your energy just can't quite get you over the top. Try not to make a big deal out of it, though, because things really just need to go at their own pace."
cancer,20211108,"Your external persona isn't matched with your inner feelings today, which can cause stress if it's allowed to persist! Try to resolve any lingering emotional business tonight."
cancer,20211109,"You can sense the truth even when people are trying to conceal it, so make sure that you're paying attention to every cue that comes your way today. It takes some effort, but it's worth it!"
cancer,20211110,"Your brainy energy is heightened today if you use the cold, hard, logical side. It might be tempting to fly off the handle, but you're much better off just coolly responding to the issues at hand."
cancer,20211111,"If you're trying to make your case today, go for the left-brain arguments. Appeals to emotion are more likely to fall on deaf ears even if they seem screamingly effective to you."
cancer,20211112,Avoid anything that requires too much logical thinking today. You need to rely more on your intuitive powers. It's a good time for you to check in with folks who've been out of touch for too long.
cancer,20211113,"Your great mental energy is turning to big-picture issues, and you may find that you're ignoring menial tasks in favor of philosophical speculation. There's no special reason to get back to work!"
cancer,20211114,"You need to chill out a bit and make sure that you're not speaking out of turn. It's way too easy for you to offend the wrong people today! Things may seem a little wacky, but you can manage."
cancer,20211115,"Suspicion can easily turn into paranoia on a day like today. That's not to say that you need to push aside any doubts, but you do need to make sure that you're not going off the deep end."
cancer,20211116,Teams suit you better than pairs or going solo today. You'd rather mix it up with many minds than focus on just one. It's a good time to volunteer for a group activity or join a work team.
cancer,20211117,"It's your job to get things moving today, so make sure that you're lively and paying attention when people start to gather. It's easier than you may think to start up some new project."
cancer,20211118,"Now is the time for you to follow up on that one old e-mail or task that you've been putting off for too long. Your practical energy is perfect for the task, and you should be able to get it done easily."
cancer,20211119,"This is not the time to stay at home quietly. You need to get out in the world and shake things up! You might want to check out the nightlife or a new gallery, but live it up!"
cancer,20211120,"Nobody seems to be in charge today, so take advantage of that and do what comes naturally. You should find that people are more willing to look the other way if you get in trouble."
cancer,20211121,"Your energy level is sky-high, and you could find that you can almost literally run circles around the competition. Make the most of this time and see if you can push ahead some more."
cancer,20211122,An emotional misfire turns out to be the best thing that's happened in ages. It could reveal a hidden truth or send you scurrying down a path that is much more positive for you in the long run.
cancer,20211123,Today marks the beginning of something positive. Your energy can't be misinterpreted and can't move in the wrong direction. It's a great time to take leaps of faith and build up your confidence.
cancer,20211124,You should not be playing it meek and mild. Just make sure that you're doing whatever comes naturally no matter how outrageous it may seem. Things are about to get really interesting!
cancer,20211125,"Don't worry about how great things are today. You do deserve this, and you shouldn't fear for the future. Life is getting even better, actually, as long as you push yourself to do things right."
cancer,20211126,"Now is the best time for you to make plans for tomorrow, next week, or the next ten years. You can grasp thoughts and ideas that fit together well and then stick to the program."
cancer,20211127,Now is a good time to clean up old messes or make room for new people or projects. Your energy is just right for making your life tidier and more receptive to good fortune.
cancer,20211128,"You connect with people in a new, more exciting way, and it means that things are sure to get a little better for everyone involved. You may find that your energy is driving you toward new social experiences."
cancer,20211129,"Focus on your home today even if you're traveling or stuck at work. Your energy is a bit diffuse, but you should be able to focus it on cleaning, repairs, or communicating with family."

cancer,20211201,"You can't quite come to decisions today, so let your mind wander wherever it needs to go. You may find that your energy is better spent on artistic notions anyway."
cancer,20211202,"Things are getting pretty intense today. At least one bomb could get dropped before lunch. The good news is that this is all heading in a positive direction, so ride it out and see where you end up."
cancer,20211203,"Something comes up that deserves extra scrutiny. Your emotional energy is great, but you need to make sure that you're skeptical even of your intuition."
cancer,20211204,"Your ability to help people is greatly enhanced today, though it could come at the cost of your own comfort. Try not to worry about it, because you should earn enough karma to win a long break."
cancer,20211205,"This is the time to take care of yourself. Your needs have to come first. That may get awkward, especially later, but you can't help others if you can't help yourself."
cancer,20211206,"This isn't really a gold-star social day for you. Maybe you're down, or maybe you just need some alone time. In either case, you should make a single exception for someone in need."
cancer,20211207,"Something big and unavoidable has popped up, leaving you unsure how to proceed. Try not to worry yourself too much. Just get started and the correct path should reveal itself."
cancer,20211208,"Money could be a problem today, though it's not likely to be a run-of-the-mill cash-flow issue. You may have a windfall with no place to stash it or need to choose between different loan requests."
cancer,20211209,"Group projects are harder than usual to manage today, so make sure that you're focused on what's most important. You definitely have to choose your battles wisely, because one team member is sure to be trouble."
cancer,20211210,"Your energy level is topped up and almost entirely positive. You should be able to make great progress on almost anything you set your mind to, which means that life is just about to improve."
cancer,20211211,"Its harder than usual to retain focus on any one issue or problem, so tackle them all! You can make a little progress in a million different directions, and that should be enough for one day."
cancer,20211212,"Your mind is crackling with speedy energy, and you may find that your ideas outpace reality a bit. That's okay! In fact, you should be able to take notes and hold onto those that aren't quite workable yet."
cancer,20211213,"Nostalgia isn't always painful. Today, it feels warm and refreshing. You might recall childhood years or a recent memory of happy times, but it definitely provides the boost you need."
cancer,20211214,It's time to get social. Your energy insists upon it! That could be as simple as grabbing lunch with co-workers or as complicated as planning a major gathering at your place. Go for it!
cancer,20211215,"A social gathering is in your near future, and something that starts there is sure to play a major role in your life. Play close attention and make sure that you're showing off your best side."
cancer,20211216,"You've got a lot going on inside you today, and that may manifest as a kind of internal dialogue that you can't shut off. Don't bother trying! It should be enlightening and maybe even entertaining."
cancer,20211217,"It's okay to let yourself get out there a little. Things should make a lot more sense once you've seen them from a distance! If you worry that others see you as eccentric, remember that that has its own power."
cancer,20211218,"You've got twice as much energy as usual, so make the most of it! It may feel as if there are two of you working together, which could start to get weird. But you do pretty well with weird!"
cancer,20211219,"You have to focus on personal issues today. Otherwise, things may never get off the ground. If a good friend or family member has a problem, help out, but then return to your own stuff."
cancer,20211220,"Energy levels are sky-high today, though you may find that at least one colleague is down in the dumps. Do what you can for them, but you can't use all you've got on their issues."
cancer,20211221,"You feel extravagant today, so much so that you may decide to make a big purchase or deal with people as if you were a monarch. Enjoy the energy, but don't expect it to last forever."
cancer,20211222,"An impulsive decision leads to a new way of doing business, but it seems to work out well for you in the long run. It's one of those days when you ought to be able to surprise your people."
cancer,20211223,"Open up to someone new today. Your communication skills are highlighted, and you may find yourself saying something old in a new way. That's good for everyone, and it helps you make new contacts."
cancer,20211224,"You're feeling good and then you spot a little detail that makes you feel ten times better! It may be purely aesthetic or something deeply meaningful, but it makes a big difference."

leo,20210601,"A friend or colleague comes to you with a financial proposition, but you should be wary, at least this time. The stars align might later in the year, but for now you should let someone else take the bait."

virgo,20210312,You feel somewhat lost today because you're confused by details that made sense to you just a few days or weeks ago. Try not to make a big deal out of it. Things will clear up soon.
virgo,20210313,"Your problems with colleagues run deep today, so try not to blow up on them! It's one of those times when you can be sure that disagreements will quickly turn into skirmishes."
virgo,20210314,"Your sense of purpose is fully engaged today, so make sure that you're not just spinning your wheels. If you're not doing something that's meaningful to you, you have to move on."
virgo,20210315,"Your boisterous nature is out in the open, and you may find that your people are more willing to give you the space you need to do your work and have fun with it. Share the love!"
virgo,20210316,"You've got a weird craving, so get out there and scratch that itch! Your energy is perfect for trying new food, meeting new people, and finding new ways to enjoy your life. Live it up!"
virgo,20210317,"Your great personal energy leads to a highly productive day, if productivity is what you're looking for, that is! You may want to step up your job search or clean the house from top to bottom."
virgo,20210318,"All you can give is 100 percent, football coaches and other inspirational types notwithstanding. Do what you can today, but don't worry if things don't work out. Your tenacity is one of your best assets!"
virgo,20210319,"Communication is key now, so push through a few new big ideas so your people can think them over. It's not a good day for action, but it's great for planning and talking."
virgo,20210320,"Your quick reasoning saves the day once again! You may find that your energy is better spent on thinking than on getting things done, but there's nothing wrong with that! Pay attention."
virgo,20210321,"Protecting the people closest to you is important. Home security and sheltering younger siblings, friends, or your children from bullying and peer pressure are top priorities."
virgo,20210322,"If you start to flag late in the day, call up a friend or visit a colleague. Your energy matches that of others, so if you can find someone who's on the right wavelength, you're all set!"
virgo,20210323,"You need to deal with your plans and those of your friends and colleagues, but your energy isn't quite up to the task of getting everyone organized. It's time to prioritize and make decisions."
virgo,20210324,"It's time to adapt to circumstances. Otherwise, you could be left behind! Your energy is best spent on reconfiguring your plans so they can work with the curveballs that the day is throwing your way."
virgo,20210325,"You typically stick to your plans no matter what, but today makes that impossible. A small wrinkle early in the day could throw everything out of order unless you improvise like a master!"
virgo,20210326,"Things are starting to really make sense, and your amazing mental energy helps you see how you can do even better. Explore new options and see about starting a new chapter of your life."
virgo,20210327,"Don't hog all this amazing energy for yourself! At least one close friend or co-worker needs a hand in a big way, and you should be able to make a real difference and score some bonus karma too!"
virgo,20210328,"Watch out for crazy deals today. You are more prone than usual to impulse purchases, and buyer's remorse is sure to be twice as bittersweet once it's all done. Force yourself to wait."
virgo,20210329,You need to make a real difference with that one friend or colleague when they least expect it! Make a real splash and they're sure to remember what you said when the time is right.
virgo,20210330,"You could feel somewhat restless, especially toward the end of the day. Your personal energy is simply harder to focus, so if you can let your mind wander, you may not get the itch to roam physically."
virgo,20210331,"You're feeling somewhat restless today, but that's not such a bad thing! You might wander off into some exciting new territory or finally say goodbye to a toxic relationship. Go for it!"
virgo,20210401,"Take a risk today! Even if that just means standing up to that office bully, you need to do something that pushes you out of your comfort zone. Once you do, the universe realigns to accommodate your bold action."
virgo,20210402,"""Bravery"" is the keyword of the day, and you should know exactly when it's needed. You may find it hard to get others to follow your lead, but you're the only one who has to take this stand."
virgo,20210403,You finally catch a break and it feels great! Things should really start to line up in your favor thanks to all the hard work you've put in over the past few years. Keep it up and enjoy!
virgo,20210404,"Are you single and looking for someone? If so, this is the perfect day to keep an eye out for the ideal prospect. Love can strike almost anywhere."
virgo,20210405,"You find that one little misstep knocks you off-balance for the day, but it may be that you need to be off balance now! Try to get your people to see that things are going to be fine."
virgo,20210406,You've got to be open-minded today or doors will close in your face! Think big and try to imagine new possibilities when you hear things that might otherwise just make you laugh.
virgo,20210407,"Try to avoid saying yes to any new projects. You've got plenty going on as it is, and anything you start today could be really hard to bring to completion. Give yourself a few days to clear some space."
virgo,20210408,
virgo,20210409,Ease up on that one kid or co-worker who drives you crazy. Criticism is doubly ineffective right now. Exercise a little patience and they may come around without you having to say a word.
virgo,20210410,"Try not to give in to too many requests today. You've only got so much to give, and it's inevitable that you'll be stretched too thin if you aren't firm early on. Practice saying no early and often!"
virgo,20210411,"Your finances aren't as troubling or stressful as you fear. Just slow down and think things through before making any changes. Focus on debt first, then move on to other stuff."
virgo,20210412,"Your thinking is deep today, so bust out those old problems that seemed so difficult before and see if you have any fresh thoughts. You might surprise yourself and your people!"
virgo,20210413,"You meet someone who seems to click right away. This could be a romantic thing or a work or friendship thing. Whenever it happens, make the most of it. Be ready for anything!"
virgo,20210414,"Your co-workers may be causing some problems today, so see if you can work from home or otherwise leave them out of your life. If you're looking for work, this could signal a need for a big change."
virgo,20210415,It's the details that could trip you up even though you're usually their master! Make sure that you're paying attention to every cell in the spreadsheet as you plow through work.
virgo,20210416,"Your energy is out on the extremes today, but that could be good or bad. Try to take the day as it comes, because there's no way to change your fate once it's set. The good news is that your energy improves tomorrow."
virgo,20210417,"You have to reconnect with family today. Your energy commands you to look to those closest to you, and you're sure to get quite a lot out of it."
virgo,20210418,"Your friends are standing behind you all the way, so make sure that you're moving forward with confidence. Your energy is building up to something really big, so don't look back."
virgo,20210419,"Try not to brag too much about your past accomplishments. It's the future you should be thinking about! Things are pretty good, but you need to let others take the spotlight for a bit."
virgo,20210420,"Try to bend as the winds push you. Those who can't flex are sure to break. You may find that your energy is a little diffuse, but that can make it easier to adjust to evolving circumstances."
virgo,20210421,"You've got way too much going on today, so make sure that you're refreshed and ready for whatever comes. It's just as important for you to get help when you need it. Don't be shy!"
virgo,20210422,"Try to tidy up your life today. Your energy is unstoppable; it's only the little things that slow you down. Once your surroundings are neat and clean, there's nothing that can hold you back!"
virgo,20210423,"You love the details, so dive in and make sure that you're on top of everything that's going down. You can make a lovely time go perfectly or a terrible time tolerable. Just act naturally!"
virgo,20210424,"You can make a real difference today. In fact, go out of your way to surprise someone with behavior they don't expect from you. Don't be a jerk, of course, but show a different side of yourself."
virgo,20210425,"It's time for a deep, thoughtful conversation between you and someone close. It's the perfect time for reflection, but you've also got the right kind of energy to really get at the truth."
virgo,20210426,"Reflect on your values and what they mean to you and to others. Your mental energy turns inward somewhat today, and that's a good thing. You may have an important epiphany tonight."
virgo,20210427,"Other people hold the keys to success today, but that can be positive! Your energy is best spent in collaboration, and you really need to put your listening skills to good use."
virgo,20210428,"Curiosity is killing you today, but you may not be able to satisfy it. Don't panic! You just need to revel in the big mystery and wait to see how it all fits together at some later time."
virgo,20210429,"A tense standoff is threatening to freeze you out of today's situation, but you ought to be able to get some traction if you show determination. That's a strength of yours, so go for it!"
virgo,20210430,"Your need for speed could be running into some roadblocks today, but don't despair! Just because you can't finish a project with a bang doesn't mean the results won't be great."
virgo,20210501,"It's a great day to push your agenda forward a little bit. Your ambitions are totally achievable, and you should find that it's easier than ever to step forward boldly."
virgo,20210502,"You find it somewhat easier to criticize others than to show them how to do better, but your energy is actually better for the latter! Push yourself a little harder and everyone comes out a winner."
virgo,20210503,"You have to poke around a bit today. Answers just aren't obvious. You might be able to shake things up in a good way, but only if you push yourself out further than your comfort zone."
virgo,20210504,"This is not a good day for criticism. Everyone thinks they're brainstorming, and they aren't ready for feedback just yet. Toss your own ideas up in the air. One of them may take off!"
virgo,20210505,"People are all over the map today, but you need to round them up and see if you can build a consensus. That means dishing out a lot of respect, but you've got the patience to do it."
virgo,20210506,"This could be a pretty unproductive day, but not just for you! See if you can push for some downtime or maybe even a day off for you and your people. Stranger things have happened!"
virgo,20210507,You stumble upon some hidden aspect of yourself that gives you a new sense of purpose. It's the perfect time to set a new course or shake up your life to give it a deeper meaning.
virgo,20210508,"Your high spirits could be mistaken for aggression, but only by those who don't know you well. Try to temper your outbursts with reassurance that you're in a good mood. You are, aren't you?"
virgo,20210509,"You're looking deep within yourself today, whether you mean to or not! Your amazing personal energy leads to a spiritual discovery, and you should end the day wiser than you started it."
virgo,20210510,Look into an issue that has been troubling you. It's a near certainty that you're on the verge of a breakthrough. Make sure that you're following leads and checking out anything that sounds related.
virgo,20210511,"Your left brain is hyperactive today, so let it analyze every little thing you encounter! It's a really good time for creative problem solving and helping others with their difficult issues."
virgo,20210512,"You need to be careful when speaking with family or colleagues today. Misunderstandings are more likely than ever! As long as you take care, though, it should all work out in the end."
virgo,20210513,"You're thinking more quickly on your feet, and you should be able to avoid more than one tricky situation by noticing it before it gets out of hand. Things should chill out tonight."
virgo,20210514,"You need to fall back on someone close for a little assistance. It may be easier for you to ask ahead of time, but sometimes you have to just accept that things aren't going to go your way."
virgo,20210515,Someone close needs help. Can you afford the time it's likely to take? It's a good time for you to rack up some karma and get yourself back in the game socially.
virgo,20210516,"Organization is your middle name, and you should be able to whip your people into shape without any trouble at all. It's your specialty, and things ought to be all lined up in your favor before long."
virgo,20210517,Try not to be too inflexible today. You need to go with the flow as much as you can. It's a really good time for you to indulge in something fun and silly to break you out of your seriousness.
virgo,20210518,"Your desire to help is obvious, so make sure that you're not just passively hoping someone asks. You need to step up and show someone new exactly what you can do for them. It's easy!"
virgo,20210519,You find that things are looking up for sure and that your success is more public than you realized! Expect praise from an unusual source and see if you can build on it.
virgo,20210520,"Your organizational skills are unparalleled, and today brings an opportunity to step up and really make a difference! It could be at work or home, but wherever it is, take over!"
virgo,20210521,You need to use some of your terrific energy on small-scale problems like housecleaning or bookkeeping. It's just one of those days when you feel the need to take care of the world around you.
virgo,20210522,"You need to indulge in a commercial desire, though it may be grounded in reality. A new appliance or car may be in order, but the odds are that you need to go in with a partner to make the decision."
virgo,20210523,"It's far too easy to sweat the small stuff today, so try to get some perspective. The little details that aren't lining up don't matter all that much in the long run, so do what you can to accept imperfection."
virgo,20210524,"Your emotional side is driving you today, and possibly driving you crazy! If you just sit back and let it call the shots, you are more likely to enjoy the ride, so don't resist unless disaster looms."
virgo,20210525,"Take a deeper look at the factors that are driving your life today. You may be able to tease out a previously hidden variable. That can be quite handy, so devote your energy to the search."
virgo,20210526,"You are your own drill sergeant today, and you may find that you start to resent how responsible you can be! Just tackle the important stuff and you can kick back and have fun soon."
virgo,20210527,"Try to go with the flow today, though you may feel like lashing out at the slightest provocation! It's one of those days when you've got to try to relax, if only to get past the small stuff."
virgo,20210528,Your love life sees a little boost today as you discover new ways to either meet new people or show your sweetheart what they mean to you. Open up and let your light shine brightly!
virgo,20210529,"Your fun-loving ways are making people even happier to be around you, and you should find that socializing is its own reward. Head out and you won't be disappointed."
virgo,20210530,"You should be able to reconfigure your home office or otherwise get down to business in a new, more efficient way. It's a good time to rethink the basics and see what you come up with."
virgo,20210531,"Don't fight against changes today. In fact, the quicker you are to embrace them, the more likely you are to find yourself in a radically different and better position. Go with the flow!"
virgo,20210601,"Try not to be too critical of your friends or co-workers today, though the temptation is sure to come at least once per hour! They are more fragile, and you need to accept imperfection."
virgo,20210602,"Your relationships area little bumpy today, but it's not time to change course! Just check in with the right people and make sure that you're all still committed to making things work."
virgo,20210603,"You need to find your reason for being or at least refocus on that ideal. It's a good time to inspire yourself and take off in a bold, new direction. Your confidence gets you halfway there!"
virgo,20210604,"Your energy is practically limitless today, so make the most of it! Your mood should be good too, so it's a good time for you to confront difficult social situations."
virgo,20210605,"You need to spend more time with your VIPs, those with whom you're most compatible. Things are looking good, but that just means you're in a good position to strengthen yourself."
virgo,20210606,"Your mental energy is perfect for long, meandering discussions or philosophical meditation. Either way, you're sure to learn cool new things about yourself, so get to work on that!"
virgo,20210607,"You could be inspired to travel far and wide, so even if you're stuck at home for a while, you can at least make big plans. Your great mental energy is perfect for making dreams come true."
virgo,20210608,"You are mentally agile today, able to pick up on subtle signals and figure out little details like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes. Things start to get more interesting as the day goes on."
virgo,20210609,"This is not a good day for mushy sentimentality. You need to make sure that you're rigorously logical, as much as you can be. It's hard when it comes to kids, but you have to stand firm."
virgo,20210610,Spend extra time figuring out the details beforehand. You've got to deal with people who are confusing enough on normal days. Now you need a plan to handle all the contingencies.
virgo,20210611,"Call a family meeting to see if you can resolve the issue that has been bugging you all for some time. It may take more than just one session, so have patience and see what you can get done today."
virgo,20210612,"A friend comes to you looking for a favor, but it may turn out that they can do more for you than you can for them. Log it all in the karma bank and see what comes around later."
virgo,20210613,You may not be able to keep up with the onslaught of activity today unless you can bend and sway and adjust to new information. It's easier than you think even if you're out of shape.
virgo,20210614,"You've got too much to handle today, so blow off some person or activity and get back to it some other day. It's not a betrayal if you give it your all when you've got the right kind of energy."
virgo,20210615,"You rack up some big new achievement that should leave you smiling and happy all day long, and maybe longer. It's one of those days when you feel that you can do no wrong. Go for it!"
virgo,20210616,"You're the master of organization, and today that power comes to you easily. See if you can get your people to follow your orders. Things should go much more easily for everyone that way."
virgo,20210617,It's a great day to make life easier for yourself and others. Tidy up the house or office and make sure that everything is where it belongs. Set the stage for great things to come!
virgo,20210618,"You're tempted to spend too much money on something of too little value today, so run your potential purchase past a trusted friend before you hit that ""Buy Now"" button."
virgo,20210619,"Defy expectations today. It's easy! All you have to do is take one step away from your routines and people are sure to pay attention. Once you're front and center, say what's on your mind."
virgo,20210620,"Your intellect is stimulated by even the smallest things today, so make the most of this great energy! You should find new depths in old issues and may be able to solve some tough problems."
virgo,20210621,"Dive deeper into your latest obsession. Things are getting intense, and you may find that you have a new career path or life goal ahead of you now. That's perfect for your spiritual direction."
virgo,20210622,"Your hackles rise when someone new starts speaking, but try to check your innate skepticism for just a few moments. They've got a good idea buried beneath all the jargon or doublespeak."
virgo,20210623,"Your energy wants to rush, but your common sense gets in the way and slows you down to the right speed. You may have to correct your course while you're at it, so make sure that you're paying attention!"
virgo,20210624,"Your inner being is pushing you to do something new and untested, but you know perfectly well that it won't work out, and why, for that matter. Wait for another opportunity."
virgo,20210625,"Your easy flow of energy may come out in unusual ways today. In fact, you might want to watch what you say around those with delicate egos. Your criticism could come across as an attack."
virgo,20210626,"It's time to ask out that special person or step up your current relationship. Your personal energy can easily be channeled into romance, so find the right person and turn on the charm!"
virgo,20210627,"You hit on a new trick for keeping track of your documents, clothes, or whatever else has been in disarray lately. Whatever it takes to start a new habit, go for it. This one is almost sure to be a winner!"
virgo,20210628,You need to shift things a bit or you're almost certain to find that life gets more complicated before long. Just a little tweak to your routine can be enough to make a difference.
virgo,20210629,"You might not get too much done today, but that's fine. In fact, you may prefer to spend your time working on issues that are irrelevant to work or school or home chores. Try a hobby!"
virgo,20210630,Details are the bane of your existence today even though they're usually your best friends! It may be that you're relying on old data or that you need to take a closer look at that spreadsheet.
virgo,20210701,"Work may be trouble for you, though not in the usual sense. It may be that you need to stand up to bullying or ask someone to break a bad habit. It's not easy, but it's definitely worthwhile."
virgo,20210702,"You are filled with inspiration today, so much so that you may find your life moving boldly in an exciting new direction! Run with it. This is something like destiny at work."
virgo,20210703,You should try something totally new today -- your energy needs variety! It could be as simple as a new place for lunch or as exotic as taking a spontaneous trip overseas. Go for it!
virgo,20210704,"Your productivity is sky-high right now, so make sure that you're working on something that is important to you -- or that needs to be done before you can get on to the meaningful stuff."
virgo,20210705,"The best you can do is try hard today -- there's no secret to success this time other than the usual hard work. If things don't go your way, that just means you need to try again in a few days."
virgo,20210706,"Be extra careful when using email or other indirect modes of communication today -- it's just far too easy for you to leave something open to interpretation, and that leads to all kinds of confusion."
virgo,20210707,Your mind is clicking almost perfectly today -- so make sure that you're in the thick of it when people start to make wild claims or try to fast-talk you. It should be easy to spot the falsehoods.
virgo,20210708,"You've got to spend more time with your people today -- friends, family members or close coworkers. Between fellowship and collaboration, you're sure to find plenty to keep you busy."
virgo,20210709,"You're getting a vibe off of at least one person you spend the day with -- and while there may be a subtext of romance, it's much more likely to be a different kind of compatibility. Embrace it!"
virgo,20210710,"Make a plan and stick to it as much as you can -- but too much rigidity may doom the enterprise entirely. Be firm, but not unyielding as all should end up more or less like you want it."
virgo,20210711,"It's important to adapt to today's evolving circumstances, so do whatever you can to make sure that you're making an effort to change. It shouldn't be too abrupt, and might make a real difference."
virgo,20210712,Sometimes you get fixated on one idea of how things should be -- but today brings too much variety for you to get a handle on it all. Try to just let people do what they need to do.
virgo,20210713,"Things seem to make more sense today -- so roll with it and enjoy. The good part is that your certainty doesn't feel like bossiness or fundamentalism, and others are more willing to follow along."
virgo,20210714,Your energy is meant for other people -- so help out anyone you come across. It's a good time for you to rack up some karma and build up your cred among the people who matter the most to you.
virgo,20210715,"Today is perfect for little victories -- though that almost certainly means dealing with little setbacks, too! You need to make sure that you're not just standing still, as that's the same as going backwards."
virgo,20210716,"A friend or colleague wants to share funds with you to buy something together -- and it's likely worth your while. Sharing can be tough, but now is the best time to make it work for you."
virgo,20210717,You have to take a closer look into the spiritual or emotional world today -- your energy demands it! See if you can get your people to have patience with you if you start to fall behind.
virgo,20210718,"Communication is all-important today so make sure that you're paying attention to the right people. Things are sure to get weird, but you can get even weirder without breaking a sweat!"
virgo,20210719,"You feel somewhat restless today, so much so that you could find it easier than usual to blow off steam on your own. It's a good time for you to wander away from responsibilities -- just not too far!"
virgo,20210720,"Relax a bit -- circumstances may not be quite to your liking, but you can still make progress if you just go with the flow. That might not feel quite right but you can make it work."
virgo,20210721,"You may not want to do what needs to be done today -- so force yourself. You're the master of self-discipline, and while it may not be fun, you will be glad you did it in the end."
virgo,20210722,"You don't mind openly lusting after that job, gadget or project -- your ambition is perfectly okay, and in fact you can't make much progress toward it if you try to keep it a secret. Go for it!"
virgo,20210723,"It's a good time for you to step up and try to get your people to see things your way, It may come across as overly critical, though, so do your best to sugarcoat your words when necessary."
virgo,20210724,"If you've got a problem with someone or something, make sure you let them know as gently as possible. Your energy is great, but you may come across as overbearing if you just jump right into it."
virgo,20210725,"You excel at finding new ways to get organized, and today is no exception. Make sure that you're experimenting, even with systems that you think are perfect. It's a process of evolution!"
virgo,20210726,This is a bad time to take on new work -- your energy is better spent clearing out your inbox or finding assistance for projects that you're starting to stall out on. There's no shame in that!
virgo,20210727,"Things change -- everyone knows that! It's how we deal with the changes that makes a difference, and today you need to be ready for almost anything. Your energy is better used for adaptation."
virgo,20210728,"You're extra-sassy today, which can be a good or bad thing depending on those around you. If they get you, then all is well and you're a comic gold mine. If not, you may need to tone it down a bit."
virgo,20210729,
virgo,20210730,"You have deep sympathy for someone you may not have gotten along well with in the past. Your great energy helps you forge new bonds, and you should be able to get past a problem more easily as a result."
virgo,20210731,"Your philosophical way of seeing today's events may strike some as too sanguine, but you are closer to the mark than they are. It's not a time to panic -- if anything, you may want to double down."
virgo,20210801,Travel is on your mind again -- even if you just returned from somewhere lovely. It's a great time to plan trips or to head out on something spontaneous. Get out of town -- you need to run!
virgo,20210802,"Your mental energy is nimble and engaged today, so make sure that you're checking in with your friends or colleagues who might need assistance. Score some karmic bonus points in no time!"
virgo,20210803,Your logical nature is helping you solve all sorts of problems today but it may alienate someone who is driven by emotion. Try not to let them get the wrong idea -- you do know what you're doing.
virgo,20210804,"Try not to let others interfere with your plans -- in fact, you may need to pull rank by the end of the day. Things are good, but your energy and organizational skills can make them so much better."
virgo,20210805,"You need some family time -- which could mean almost anything from playing with your kids to remembering your ancestors. It could also mean getting more serious with your sweetie, so you decide."
virgo,20210806,"It's vital that you remain flexible today -- otherwise, things are sure to get weird quickly. Your energy is best spent on projects that don't require too much collaboration, but a little is fine."
virgo,20210807,"It's a busier day than you would like, but that doesn't mean that you need to work yourself to death. Put off whatever you can until you feel you have room to breathe -- you can handle it another day."
virgo,20210808,"People are hard to deal with today -- so try hard to just relax and let them be weird. If they start to grate on your nerves, you may have to just remove yourself from the situation entirely."
virgo,20210809,You unlock some kind of achievement that warms your heart -- and the good energy that comes with it is extra-sweet! Your amazing energy helps you capitalize on this new development.
virgo,20210810,Organization is your strong suit for sure -- but there are still days when you amaze those around you. Something that seems like small potatoes to you turns out to be a really big deal.
virgo,20210811,"Keep your credit cards hidden today -- you need to avoid the impulse to throw money at your problems. Things are sure to get better in the future, but spending isn't the answer now."
virgo,20210812,"Try something new, wild and different today. Things are sure to feel right if you can just shake up your expectations. The bonus you get from surprising your friends is even better!"
virgo,20210813,"You feel drawn to something deeper and more meaningful today -- so make sure that you're pushing yourself in that new direction. It may be spiritual, romantic or neither, but you should enjoy it."
virgo,20210814,"Your brain is hungry for new information, and you should be able to get what you need with ease. If you know just what you're looking for, it comes to you unerringly; if not, expect a fun ride!"
virgo,20210815,Now is the time for serious investigations. You should be able to learn more about almost anything you set your mind to -- even existential mysteries or secrets humanity was never meant to learn.
virgo,20210816,"You're feeling the urge to rush ahead and push forward with a new project, but this is not the best time. Give it a few days and see if you can pull together a few new allies or facts to make it all work out."
virgo,20210817,"If it's up to you, today's big launch or project gets canceled. There's nothing wrong with that -- in fact, knowing when to say no is one of the key elements of real success. Don't be shy!"
virgo,20210818,"It's okay to let loose with a little creative destruction today -- your energy is good enough that the positive should far outweigh the negative. If anyone can't handle it, give them the day off."
virgo,20210819,"Romance is in the air today, and you couldn't be happier about your situation. Even if it's in flux you can tell that the road ahead is brighter than anywhere you've been before. Take a risk!"
virgo,20210820,"You stumble upon a new trick for staying organized -- and that's especially impressive for you, because you thought you knew them all! Explore and learn from this new way of seeing the world."
virgo,20210821,"You should find that the day seems to work out better for you if you try to make small changes in the way you do things. It's not that hard, and it shouldn't shake up your world too much."
virgo,20210822,"Don't let your criticism turn into nitpicking -- you've got to make sure that people know you're on their side. You have legitimate concerns, of course, but they can be expressed gently."
virgo,20210823,"You may find that your relationship issues are taking over your life -- but this is a good thing! You're in the right place to handle them with care and compassion, and you should end up in a better place."
virgo,20210824,"People seem to be doing pretty much whatever they want today, which could drive you a little crazy if they're moving too slowly for your taste. Try to get them to see things your way, but with respect."
virgo,20210825,"You're feeling more purposeful today, thanks to an infusion of energy that makes you feel both more grounded and better able to handle real-life issues. Get out there and do some good!"
virgo,20210826,Your mood is terrific -- or at least as good as it can possibly be -- and you should be able to cope with anything life gives you today. Life may improve substantially by this time tomorrow.
virgo,20210827,"You have a fish-out-of-water experience early today that colors the rest of your day. It's likely positive, though, as whatever new experience you deal with is shifting you toward something even better."
virgo,20210828,It's a great day for brainstorming -- or just dealing with that backlog of good ideas you've been compiling over the last few months. Your mental and social energy are in perfect sync.
virgo,20210829,"Your hard, cold logic is all you need to win the day -- they may have more flash or prettier presentations, but you've got the facts on your side. It's one of those days when you're on the winning team."
virgo,20210830,"A minor work issue snowballs until it turns into something you can hardly believe you really have to deal with on your own. The good news is that you can take care of it, but it takes all your energy."
virgo,20210831,"Try your best to get organized today -- things are pretty intense, but you should still be able to work your magic on the mess that surrounds you. By this time tomorrow, you should be calm again."
virgo,20210901,"Your family needs someone to help hold it together -- and that someone is you, at least for the time being. Step up and make the connections that can keep everything flowing for another year."
virgo,20210902,"Your best friends are trying to get things back on track, and you can give them the boost they need to get there. It's easy and doesn't cost you a thing, but it does earn their eternal gratitude."
virgo,20210903,"Though you may not be at the top of the charts right now, you've got a confidence and sense of purpose that should help you get there. The world loves an underdog, so make sure that they know your name."
virgo,20210904,Try not to brag too much today -- though you're busting out with pride over something or someone that's resonating deep within you. Let that go and let others talk up your achievements.
virgo,20210905,Your personal energy is off the charts today -- and you feel that you could take on any challenge! You can tap into your resources with ease and find exactly the tool you need to address almost anything.
virgo,20210906,"You need to spend a bit of this surplus energy on tidying up your surroundings, but it's easy. You are a machine that turns chaos into order and you have fun while you're doing it."
virgo,20210907,It's the little things that make you wonder what's coming next -- all the details seem to point toward something great! Now is the time to focus on the small stuff so you're ready when the big stuff comes.
virgo,20210908,"Your wallet may be your worst enemy today -- try not to interact with it too much. In fact, if you can avoid making any purchases at all today, so much the better. Your finances get back to normal soon, though."
virgo,20210909,"Someone needs to hear from you -- and they need to be impressed. It's a good time for you to make a real splash. You may not feel totally comfortable with it, but you can tell that it's for the best."
virgo,20210910,"Those around you may be confused, but your ability to explain things is seriously enhanced right now. You don't have to go into full-on lecture mode -- just a few words here and there can help."
virgo,20210911,"You can't sit still! It's hard to tackle any projects that require much focus, so try to just chill out and let your mind wander where it may. You are sure to come back with some clever ideas."
virgo,20210912,"You need to force yourself into an awkward situation -- one you would ordinarily avoid. It should all be clear afterward why your presence is so important, but for now you have to go on instinct."
virgo,20210913,"Someone needs to see you risk looking foolish, so go for it. This could be romance, business or some other relationship, but your display of vulnerability helps things immeasurably."
virgo,20210914,"Great energy is pouring through you today -- so direct some of it to your favorite people and projects. Things need a positive spin, though, so make sure that you're not overly critical."
virgo,20210915,"Are you looking for love? Now is the best time to make a move. That could be as simple as putting up an online dating profile, or as complex as asking out that friend of a friend of a friend."
virgo,20210916,"You stumble upon something new that may shake up the way you store your files or stuff. It could be an online thing, or maybe you just peek over someone's shoulder and have your mind blown."
virgo,20210917,"Try something totally new today -- even if your life seems to be working out great lately. You should find that people are more willing to experiment than usual, so it's easier to find allies."
virgo,20210918,"Your routines need some variety, so make a little change for its own sake and then see where it points you. This could lead to a revolution in the way you live your life. Go for it and surprise someone!"
virgo,20210919,"Your eyes start to swim after spending just a few minutes going over the details of your latest project. That's not exactly typical, so you may want to step away and take a break for a day or two."
virgo,20210920,You've got to avoid saying yes to any new projects today -- unless you're ready for some serious overtime! Your energy is best spent on clearing out old tasks so you'll have room for more later on.
virgo,20210921,"You're fighting against something or someone -- and you may not understand exactly why you're so upset. Just go with it, because sometimes you need to see battles through to their logical conclusion."
virgo,20210922,"Duck any requests to share resources today -- even if it makes you feel bad. There are hidden costs, and you are sure to be better off if you learn more, but that can't happen until tomorrow."
virgo,20210923,"Thoughtful energy is pulsing through your brain today, making it simple to break down problems into their component parts. You're on track to find a big answer to an old challenge."
virgo,20210924,Go in a little deeper and see if you can get your people to agree with a new level of scrutiny. It's a good time to ask big questions and ensure that the answers you're getting satisfy you.
virgo,20210925,"The little details are more important today. That means it's your turn to shine, because you know them inside-out and can point out any tiny flaws that might change things for the worse."
virgo,20210926,Today could be terrific -- or it could be terrible. There is good news if things start to go south though: You can change the outcome if you work as hard as you can on the issues that matter most.
virgo,20210927,"Take care when reaching out to clients or potential employers today -- or anyone else of importance, for that matter. It's easy to confuse people or leave them hanging, but a little effort should avoid the worst of it."
virgo,20210928,"You need a social outlet today. It may be that your energy is diffuse and needs a focus, or it could be that you've got things to discuss that can't wait for the next scheduled play date."
virgo,20210929,"It's time to ask for help. This could be as trivial as getting an opinion or as major as seeing a therapist, but you need some outside assistance if you want to make any progress from here on out."
virgo,20210930,It's not the best day to talk up your great qualities -- you need to hang back and watch what others say first. Too much bragging could come across in exactly the wrong way for you.
virgo,20211001,"It's absolutely vital that you're adaptable today -- as hard as that may be at first. Things are looking up for you, but only if you're able to change things up as you see what's really going on."
virgo,20211002,"It's a busy day for you -- too busy, possibly. Try to scrape some of the excess activities out of your life and you could make a difference. It's also a great idea to ask others to take your overflow."
virgo,20211003,Have you been planning to start something new? Now is the time to go for it! Your amazing energy helps launch anything from a new fling to a new business venture. Your odds look good.
virgo,20211004,You should feel proud of yourself -- something new you did recently has made the news (or at least is making the rounds) and people are taking notice of your many talents. Build on this!
virgo,20211005,"Something small is turning into something big -- but don't let it faze you. Your energy is strong enough to handle setbacks, so just roll up your sleeves and get to work on whatever it is."
virgo,20211006,"Be extra careful with your wallet today -- you need to avoid the temptation to spend your troubles away. Things should look better really soon, and then you can get back on track with your finances."
virgo,20211007,This is not the time for the same old same old -- you've got to shake things up! Make sure that your people are paying attention as you surprise them with a gesture or life change that really matters.
virgo,20211008,"Other people know more than they are letting on today -- so ask big questions and make sure that you're getting satisfying answers. Things are on the cusp of change, and you can adapt this time."
virgo,20211009,Your big brain is buzzing with curiosity about some new wrinkle in your social or professional world. It's a great time to ask the right questions and make sure that you're getting close to the truth.
virgo,20211010,The tension in the room is palpable -- but you can cut through it like it's just a mess of cobwebs. Your easy humor should be a huge asset as you try to get everyone to chill out.
virgo,20211011,You want to move out quickly -- but you know perfectly well that rushing is sure to cause a big setback. Just try to get your people to see that you're slowly moving in the right direction.
virgo,20211012,"Whatever you've got going for you should be just about right -- so go along with whatever plans you've made. If anything, you may want to get even more ambitious as the day goes on."
virgo,20211013,It's all too easy for you to criticize instead of offering constructive praise today -- so try to go with your positive energy whenever possible. Things should improve throughout the day if you do.
virgo,20211014,"Your energy is a bit diffuse today, so you may find it harder than usual to keep your comments productive. That's not to say you're mean-spirited, of course; just that you need to keep it upbeat."
virgo,20211015,You stumble upon a new trick for staying organized -- sometimes it pays for you to mess around and stray from the path! It's a great time to share your new ideas with those around you.
virgo,20211016,Don't take on anything new today -- even if it seems fun or interesting. Your energy is much better spent on closing up old projects than it is on moving in new directions. Give it a few days more.
virgo,20211017,"You know better than most that everything changes -- not that you like every new thing that pops up along the way! Today brings a shift that may be more intriguing, as long as you can keep up with it."
virgo,20211018,You're having some problems with colleagues today -- but that doesn't mean that you need to storm out of the office or call in sick. Just make sure that you're on top of it all and things should go your way.
virgo,20211019,"You know what you want and you know how to get it -- your energy is unusually focused, and you should find that your people are ready for almost anything. Lead the way toward the future!"
virgo,20211020,"You're exploring greater emotional or intellectual depths today, and you may find that you're at a very different place by this time tomorrow. Keep pushing -- the best is yet to come!"
virgo,20211021,Someone who is usually not congenial is surprisingly easy to work with today -- so roll with it and make sure that you're giving them the attention they need. This is leading somewhere good.
virgo,20211022,"Your philosophical musings are actually getting you somewhere today, so keep them alive as long as possible. You should end up with a new perspective on something quite important."
virgo,20211023,"Communication is essential today -- but you need to be warier about what you say and how you say it. If you choose each word carefully, you should be fine, but if you slip up, you may have to backtrack."
virgo,20211024,Your quick mind is helping you to get through almost anything today. You should be able to dazzle folks in meetings or interviews -- to say nothing of dates -- so get talking and let your wit rule.
virgo,20211025,Put your skills to work organizing at work or at home -- you can't make much progress until you've got a new system for keeping track of facts or inventory or whatever has been bugging you lately.
virgo,20211026,"Gather your family together -- at least online -- for a chat about what's coming next. It could be vacation plans or something bigger, but you need input from all the key players first."
virgo,20211027,"No matter where you find yourself, you are surrounded by people who seem to have more chutzpah than they deserve. Expect too many requests and possibly too much work to complete."
virgo,20211028,Life gets too busy to handle today -- but you should be able to call in reinforcements. Expect greatness and you are sure to get pleasing results. One important person comes into greater prominence.
virgo,20211029,There's a bit too much going on for you to keep track of it all. That's not to say that you're overwhelmed -- just that you'd rather take things one step at a time. Try to clear out anything extraneous.
virgo,20211030,"It's a great day to spend cleaning or neatening -- while that's not the sexiest use of your time, it does scratch an itch that feels good. Better yet, you're set for adventures that are sure to come."
virgo,20211031,Your understanding of the small details increases dramatically today -- and your great mental energy helps you to make the most of it. You should be able to make real progress in a new direction.
virgo,20211101,"You've got to get serious with someone. It might be a colleague or potential love interest, but in any case, it's essential that you come to a deeper understanding of where you're headed."
virgo,20211102,"You can't quite make up your mind about something or someone today, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you're forced to make a decision, you just might have to flip a coin."
virgo,20211103,"You're getting in deeper with someone, though it may not be a romantic affair. It's a good time to work together and see what, if anything, comes out of this partnership."
virgo,20211104,"An old ambition turns out to be unrealistic, but that's okay! You pride yourself on your common sense, so choose something that you can actually achieve. You are sure to end up happier in the long run."
virgo,20211105,"Your emotional side is driving things today, so make sure that you're paying close attention to your feelings. It's a great time for you to be focused on family and socializing, if possible."
virgo,20211106,"You may feel stuck in a rut, but this isn't the right time to unstick yourself. Try to get a handle on your situation so you can have an easier time in a few days when things start to loosen up."
virgo,20211107,"You pride yourself on your sense of responsibility, and today practically guarantees that things are working out such that you've got to swing from one obligation to the next. You're earning massive karma!"
virgo,20211108,"Today's rewards come quickly and deservedly! You've been working hard to achieve this, and it's great to see it finally come through for you. Make sure everyone gets their fair share!"
virgo,20211109,"Your love life could take an unexpected turn, so make sure you're looking your best. In fact, work or school are the likeliest places for you to meet someone new, so pay close attention there."
virgo,20211110,Try to keep an open mind today or things might start to go sideways early in the day. A crazy idea turns out to be extremely sensible upon further investigation.
virgo,20211111,"The best way to learn today is by trial and error. You have to accept that things could slip up, but that just means you'll be that much wiser in the long run."
virgo,20211112,"Your friends and family may exasperate you today. They're like preschool kids, seemingly unable to care for themselves or get themselves ready for anything. It's hard to be responsible sometimes."
virgo,20211113,"Opinions are coming your way from all directions, but you should try to just chill out and let them flow. If you try to counter all the obvious flaws, you'll never get any actual work done."
virgo,20211114,"This isn't the best time to share resources. In fact, you might want to duck away if others come looking for what they think ought to be theirs. Things will look better in a few days."
virgo,20211115,"A small financial problem could turn into something much bigger, so take your time when considering how to handle it. You might want to call on someone who deals with this professionally."
virgo,20211116,Today is the perfect day to try something foreign or even alien. You are well prepared for novelty and should find it easier than ever to accommodate new ways of seeing the world.

virgo,20211119,"Take a second or third look at that contract or database before signing off on it. Your eye for detail is better than ever, and that's saying something! Things need to be exactly right this time."
virgo,20211120,"You have to do your best today. Something big is on the line, and it all comes down to you. Even if you can't quite make it, though, the right people are watching to see how hard you try."
virgo,20211121,Your friends are pulling you toward something new and you need to follow! It's a good idea for you to step up and make sure that you're really doing what's right for you and your family.
virgo,20211122,"Your social life sees a boost today like it or not! Of course, the odds are good that you're going to enjoy the time you spend with your people, but even if you're introverted, you can still use a friendly smile."

virgo,20211129,"You need to be wary of your impulses, especially as far as shopping is concerned. Things are sure to start getting weirder once you start checking your bank accounts, so hold steady for now."
virgo,20211130,"Make a splash and make it memorable! Your great personality is aching for change, and you have the license to do practically anything you want today. Go for it with confidence!"
virgo,20211201,"Your intellect is pushing you in a new direction today, and you're likely to run into someone or something from your past along the way. It's not that life is a circle so much as a series of loops."
virgo,20211202,"Go deep into your next big thing. It's vital that you find yourself at the center of it all. Intensity doesn't always suit you, but that just means that you're going to surprise someone."
virgo,20211203,"Your skeptical side is dominant today, which could be a problem since you've got at least one project to deal with. Swallow disbelief as much as you can, at least until things start to unravel."
virgo,20211204,Your desire to move quickly is running into problems thanks to that pesky slowpoke called reality. Try to just keep moving at a steady pace and things should be a lot better quite soon.

virgo,20211206,"Your creative energy is flowing, but it's way too easy for you to get stuck in self-criticism. Break yourself out of it however you can, maybe with friends, maybe with a change of venue."

virgo,20211210,"Ease up on that kid or intern or anyone else who ends up in your crosshairs. It's vital that you keep your criticisms to yourself for now, if only to let them learn their lessons on their own."

scorpio,20210521,"Some good news comes your way, and it's likely to influence your mood for a while! You should make good use of this information because it's sure to give you an edge."
scorpio,20210522,"If you've been banging your head against the wall trying to come up with a winning game plan, try going for a default instead. Let this one slide and you should be in a much stronger position in the future."

scorpio,20210608,"Work issues need greater care and delicacy than usual today. Make sure that you're giving them your all. Someone you trust may have a hidden agenda, so assume the worst while you plan for the best."
scorpio,20210609,"Things seem to be chugging along just fine until you're stopped by one crazy detail. It's hard to say what it could be, but once you spot it, you find it hard to focus on anything else."

scorpio,20210723,"A conflict arises out of two opposing ideas. You are firmly in one camp, but you may not be able to see a way out of this tussle. Look to a wise friend or colleague to rise above it all."
scorpio,20210724,"A parent or other relative presents an odd problem -- and it's one that you may have to solve on your own. Sometimes you're the only grownup in the family, or so it seems. Have patience!"

scorpio,20210731,You need to try a little openness today -- even with someone you have reason not to trust. Sometimes you have to take the moral high ground in order to get moving in the right direction.
scorpio,20210801,"You're the underdog today -- but that just means your victory will be that much sweeter when it finally arrives. Of course, you have to work twice as hard to get there, but that shouldn't be a problem."
scorpio,20210802,"You need to take greater care at work today -- though it's not so much a safety issue as a financial issue, most likely. Your energy is a bit out of sync with those around you, but you can make up for it."
scorpio,20210803,"Something small is all-important today -- so make sure you're paying attention to all the little details. Once you spot the flaw, you can't keep yourself from diving right in to fix it."
scorpio,20210804,"Now is the time to get your way, even if you're not quite sure what you want or need. Things are sure to improve in some way as long as you push yourself to go for what you really want once you find it."
scorpio,20210805,"Your intuitive energy is quite powerful today! That could mean that you're in the right space to take care of something tricky that has been on the back burner, so brace yourself and get on it!"
scorpio,20210806,"You need a greater challenge today -- so step up your game and see what you can find. Boredom is poison to you, and if your brain isn't actively engaged, you're sure to feel sick to your stomach."
scorpio,20210807,"Your boss at work -- or anyone else who styles themselves your superior -- may be a problem today. This isn't a good time to rock the boat, though, so do what you can to just chill out."
scorpio,20210808,"Your ego runs smack up against that of someone else, so watch out for sparks! The good news is that you're not likely to create any long-term problems as this is a time-limited situation."
scorpio,20210809,"You are great with secrets -- so much so that you know instinctively whom to trust with them. Now is a good time to bring someone into the inner circle. You know who it is, so get to it!"
scorpio,20210810,"Your friends are supporting you more than you even realize. Things are looking up, and your group is on the forefront of something exciting -- and maybe also a little scary. You can handle that!"
scorpio,20210811,"Can you blow off that decision for a few more days? If so, go for it -- you're not in the most decisive mood right now, and that could mean that you end up making life more difficult."
scorpio,20210812,Your conscious mind is not in total control today -- but you're fine. It's one of those days when you just need to make sure that you're willing to act on impulse and let your subconscious run the show.
scorpio,20210813,"Something's a little weird today -- but you're not sure what to make of it! Just let it ride and see if you can figure it out later. Things should make sense soon, once it rises out of your subliminal state of awareness."
scorpio,20210814,"'Intense' is a word people often use to describe you, and today shows how they're right. Your energy is focused like a laser, but it is entirely positive, so don't worry about the consequences."
scorpio,20210815,"Your magnetic personality is pulling even more people into your proximity, and this can only be a good thing. If you need some down time, you are sure to get something more or less like that soon."
scorpio,20210816,"Your impulsive side comes to you in a new way today -- and it may cause some financial distress! If you buy something big, try to keep the receipt, as you're likely to want to backtrack soon."
scorpio,20210817,"Take a risk! You may not pull it off, but the mere act of pushing your luck is sure to get the attention of the right person or supernatural being. You need to show your fearlessness now."
scorpio,20210818,"You need to figure out whose willpower is the strongest in today's confrontation -- that is who's likeliest to come out ahead. Your good energy gives you an edge, but no guarantees."
scorpio,20210819,"Ambition is the word of the day. You may find that you know what you want much more clearly, and that means you are better able to go for it. Things are sure to work out for you in the long run if you move now."
scorpio,20210820,"You've got problems at home, but nothing you can't handle -- in fact, you may find that you've got more energy than ever when it comes to domestic issues. Things are sure to get better soon!"
scorpio,20210821,"You've got some serious issues brewing in your home base, but every problem has a solution. You should be able to figure it all out if you just face up to whatever the root of the problem is."
scorpio,20210822,"Your love life is on the upswing today -- so enjoy the good times! Even if you're single, you should hit on a new lead or meet someone new and cute. Chances are you're due for a break!"
scorpio,20210823,"A burst of creativity jolts your day and sets you off in a new direction. It could be almost anything from a new art project to a dream that leads you to a new job, so pay attention and go for it!"
scorpio,20210824,"Your imagination is more powerful than you realize -- and on a day like today, you can bring your dreams to life with ease. Take action and make sure that you're keeping yourself on track."
scorpio,20210825,Your selfless acts are making life better for those around you -- but also improving your karma significantly! Today beings a big payoff that should reinvigorate your volunteer spirit.
scorpio,20210826,"Focus your energy on other people today -- you can't make much progress on your own issues, but you can make a real difference for others. Check in with your more hapless friends first."
scorpio,20210827,"You're in a strange situation, and might have a hard time believing your eyes. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't slip into denial. Things are turning the corner toward awesome."
scorpio,20210828,"It's all up to you -- but you thrive on the pressure! Your energy is all over the map, which actually ends up helping you as you have to deal with lots of different mini-emergencies throughout the day."
scorpio,20210829,"Are you paying attention to the small stuff? That's what's most important right now, and you can possibly make a real difference if you're in a position to catch the one flaw that can break everything."
scorpio,20210830,"Don't sign anything without reading the fine print -- or getting someone you trust to do it for you. Things are not perfectly suited to your way of doing business, but they will be soon."
scorpio,20210831,"Try to let go of someone you care for -- their freedom trumps everything, and if they run away at top speed, that's how it's meant to be. More likely they'll stay in your orbit, which is for the best."
scorpio,20210901,"Push for your latest ambition today -- you can get what you want a little more easily. Of course, you need to close your eyes and use the Force a bit, because control is tough on a day like today."
scorpio,20210902,"Intuition is your most serious asset today, so make the most of it. Your personal energy is growing stronger by the hour, and you definitely need to deploy it before things start to get really crazy."
scorpio,20210903,"You're having a problem that doesn't seem to go away, so it's best to just wait it out -- unless, of course, you like battering your head against brick walls, in which case, go ahead and try to fix it today."
scorpio,20210904,"You need to deal with an ego problem -- but the thing is, it may be yours. Try not to inflict your own issues on anyone else, and remember that what you feel now may not feel true tomorrow."
scorpio,20210905,"A friend comes to you with a request -- and it's one that you are better off helping them out with ASAP. Even if it seems dumb or crazy, it leads to something really good for both of you."
scorpio,20210906,"You're pretty good with secrets, but you stumble on one today that makes you question whether or not you ought to keep quiet about it. Try not to worry -- you should be able to get to the truth."
scorpio,20210907,"Your energy is a bit flat -- but it's perfect for making plans. You are unlikely to invest too much in any one factor, and you should be able to see as clearly as possible what the likely outcomes are."
scorpio,20210908,"You need to show others that you know what's really going on -- so make sure that you're speaking as plainly as you can about this latest weirdness going on at home or at work. It may feel weird, but it's vital."
scorpio,20210909,"Exercise patience and restraint today -- as hard as that may be to accomplish. You need to let this situation play out organically, even if it feels like doing so could be catastrophic."
scorpio,20210910,"Personal magnetism draws others to you without any effort on your part, so it's a great time to get a date or influence your coworkers to see things your way. Don't get too tricky, though!"
scorpio,20210911,"Your energy is projecting outward today -- other people are glad you're around, and may stick by you longer than they would ordinarily. Work together to build something really great!"
scorpio,20210912,"Someone new bends your ear and may convince you that you've been thinking about a problem all wrong -- maybe for months or years! It's a good time to change course, so listen up."
scorpio,20210913,Your gut is your best guide today -- so make sure that you're paying close attention to the subtle cues it's giving off. Your ability to discern instinct from bias is all-important at the moment.
scorpio,20210914,"Get started on something new today -- it could be almost anything, as long as it takes your initiative. If you don't make use of it by the end of the day, it may fester and turn to something negative."
scorpio,20210915,"You need to move from the idea stage to the action stage -- and it's easy on a day like today! See if you can get your people to follow your lead, as that is the best way to make sure this gets done right."
scorpio,20210916,"In order to get what you want, you are almost certainly going to have to compromise. That could mean anything, so keep your ears open and your mind flexible. Things make more sense soon."
scorpio,20210917,"Something's going on with your living space. It could just be a leaky faucet, but it could be as major as termites or structural damage. Address it soon -- the faster, the better. Procrastination is the enemy."
scorpio,20210918,"Expect a few problems with family or roommates -- but nothing you can't handle. Your energy is just right for dealing with conflict, so be respectful and you can ensure success."
scorpio,20210919,"A dream contains a message for you, so make sure that you're ready to receive it. These kinds of communications can be vague or ambiguous, but you should have a better grasp this time."
scorpio,20210920,"Your love life is ramping up, and you may feel as if you're living in a Hallmark card. Go for it! Ask out that hottie or remind your partner why they fell for you in the first place."
scorpio,20210921,It's a great day to take care of your health. That could mean almost anything from taking the stairs instead of the elevator to purging your house of all refined sugar. Be ruthless and enjoy the results!
scorpio,20210922,"You're starting on something new and cool today -- or you should be! Your energy is perfect for beginnings, and anything that starts today is sure to be positive for you in the long run."
scorpio,20210923,"You are feeling pretty strange today -- everything is intensified somewhat. It may be a good idea for you to pull back from the person who's provoking you, unless it feels like a positive thing."
scorpio,20210924,"You're at one end of a spectrum today -- but someone close is almost certainly all the way over at the other end! That makes communication difficult, but this is ultimately a good thing for both of you."
scorpio,20210925,Money is hard to handle right now -- but you might have to do so anyway! It's one of those days when you really need to make sure that you're pushing things as far as you think they can go.
scorpio,20210926,"A gamble of some kind seems quite appealing -- but you need to avoid the temptation this time. Even if you win, you're not likely to come out ahead. Just enjoy the show and try again later."
scorpio,20210927,You need to beware of temptation today -- it may come from any direction. See if you can get yourself set up to take care of business from home or somewhere else where you're in control.
scorpio,20210928,"An intense conversation takes you and one other person in a brand new direction. It could be a new business, a new romance or even a new spiritual path -- but you've got to take it all the way!"
scorpio,20210929,"This is not the right time for power plays -- you can't control the situation as much as you'd like, but there's nothing wrong with that. Just let others do what they're going to do anyway and see what happens next."
scorpio,20210930,"You've got to be extra wary when it comes to your own behavior today -- you could be your own worst enemy if you aren't vigilant. The good news is that once you see what's up, it's easy to fix."
scorpio,20211001,"A new challenge comes your way -- are you ready for it? This could turn into something really big if you let it, or it could just turn out to be a new opportunity to show off a little."
scorpio,20211002,"Your work situation needs some improvement -- so make sure that you're dealing with it appropriately. Your boss is causing more problems than they're solving, but you can get in the way of that."
scorpio,20211003,Show that you can be of value to someone who may not have received that lesson quite yet. Your energy is great for helping others achieve their goals. They should remember you fondly.
scorpio,20211004,"A big secret spills out today -- but it's one that you already knew, so there's no spoiler involved. You may actually be better off now that it's out in the open. Watch and wait before reacting."
scorpio,20211005,"Have patience! You need to take slow, careful steps today -- not to avoid peril, but just because there's too much going on for you to be able to make plans farther out than an hour or so."
scorpio,20211006,"You've got a lot of factors to consider today -- which could make decisions harder to come by. If someone is pressuring you, push back with all you've got. Take your time and get it right."
scorpio,20211007,"You feel a bit confused about what's going on -- and how you're responding to it all. Your subconscious may be driving today, but that can be a good thing. Kick back in the passenger seat and enjoy the view."
scorpio,20211008,You are entering a new phase of life -- and you're doing it with remarkably positive energy! It's a good time to leave behind old baggage or wounds that you thought you'd carry with you forever.
scorpio,20211009,An intense encounter turns into something much more interesting -- so make sure that you're ready for anything! Your terrific personal energy is a beacon to those who can complete your life.
scorpio,20211010,"Listen to your instinct when making decisions today -- you're more centered, and should be able to access a deeper level of your subconscious. You're likely to move out in the best direction."
scorpio,20211011,"An impulsive decision may cost you more than you think -- but it's not catastrophic. Sometimes you need to roll the dice and see what happens, and today is just another shake-up."
scorpio,20211012,"Your group is working well together, and that's thanks in large part to your quiet contribution. You're not at your most intense, but that is actually working to your advantage."
scorpio,20211013,"Today's conflict comes down to basic willpower. You may find that you've got what it takes without drawing on any reserves, but don't hesitate to call on your deepest self to help out."
scorpio,20211014,"It may be a bit harder for you to open up to new ideas today -- so see if you can trick yourself! Just because you're not feeling it, that doesn't mean you won't have a change of heart tomorrow."
scorpio,20211015,"A small conflict at home could turn into a raging fight if you can't see it for what it is. Sometimes folks just need to let off steam, and home is the best place for that. As long as everyone stays in bounds, let it go."
scorpio,20211016,"A dream is more significant than it seems -- so write them all down, even if they seem trivial. Very soon, you should recognize it for what it is, and then life starts to get really interesting!"
scorpio,20211017,"Your sweetheart gets quite a bit sweeter -- or that new crush says something that makes your heart skip a beat. It's a great time to focus on your love life, no matter how it was yesterday."
scorpio,20211018,"Today is perfect for starting in new directions -- even if you are satisfied with what you've got. Your energy is a little scattered, but it comes into focus when you try some new activity."
scorpio,20211019,"It's vital that you take your time and be as methodical as you can today -- otherwise, you're unlikely to get very far. If you can focus, though, all should work out the right way."
scorpio,20211020,Something small starts wreaking havoc with your schedule -- or maybe with your peace of mind. The good news is that this issue is unlikely to be anything but positive in the long run.
scorpio,20211021,You need to avoid the temptation to lash out at people who feel abrasive today -- in part because you're far more sensitive than usual. It's a good time to just hunker down and focus on your own work.
scorpio,20211022,"You're facing down someone you see almost every day who has suddenly turned antagonistic. Try not to alienate them, but you do need to be firm about anything that's important to you."
scorpio,20211023,A minor temptation may turn into something much bigger -- so make sure that you're doing whatever it takes to build up your willpower! It shouldn't take much for you to get there.
scorpio,20211024,"You're feeling careful today -- which is a good thing! At work or at school or pretty much anywhere else, you've got to watch out for little details that don't feel right. They're easy to fix, fortunately."
scorpio,20211025,Your energy is quite potent today -- but you need to avoid the temptation to push it too hard! Things may start to get more interesting later on as little things all start to go your way.
scorpio,20211026,"Your instincts are sounder than ever, so trust your gut all day long. You should find yourself in a very different place tonight, but it's almost certain to be much better than where you started out."
scorpio,20211027,"An ego struggle is making life really difficult for you -- and for one person close to you. Seeing it for what it is can help a little, but only if you're willing to step back and apologize first."
scorpio,20211028,"Power is always tricky to handle -- but you've got a golden opportunity to take on a little more today. Even if you don't feel up to the challenge, you should still push yourself a little."
scorpio,20211029,"Your inner power is growing, so make sure that you're pushing yourself in new directions. You may find that people are more willing to give you room to breathe if you ask for it."
scorpio,20211030,"New information comes your way today -- so you need to adjust your plans accordingly. You can do so thanks to your sharp mental energy, but you may need to clue in your friends or colleagues."
scorpio,20211031,"Plans can change -- and no one knows that better than you. Today brings multiple shifts that require you to snap into action, so make sure that you're ready for anything and supremely flexible."
scorpio,20211101,"Something just beyond your reach is causing problems, but you need to make sure that you're dealing with the real issue. That can be tricky, but nobody is trickier than you!"
scorpio,20211102,"You're feeling a bit introverted today, and there's nothing wrong with that, of course! If you can just shut your door and work on your own, that's optimal, but you might need to interact at least a little."
scorpio,20211103,"It's not the best day for taking action. You are much better off dealing with circumstances as they arise. It may feel passive, but sometimes that is the best of all possible options."
scorpio,20211104,"You feel stronger than ever today, and with good reason! Your amazing personal energy helps you to see the difference between where you are and where you want to be, making it easier to get there."
scorpio,20211105,You can clearly see what needs to come next for you or your people. It's the perfect time for you to lead the way even if that's not your usual role. People are much more willing to follow along.
scorpio,20211106,"You feel somewhat energized by a new development, so much so that you may lose sight of your plans. That's not a real problem as long as you can bring yourself back to reality sometime soon."
scorpio,20211107,You may be letting abstract notions guide your important life decisions today. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that as long as you're comfortable with the consequences.
scorpio,20211108,"Self-control comes more easily to you today, and it shouldn't be tough for you to say no to an obvious temptation. Make sure that you're polite but firm. Sometimes you have to take charge."
scorpio,20211109,"Your business sense is much more impressive than usual today, which could be saying a lot! It's a great time to make deals and ask for more than you thought you could get yesterday."
scorpio,20211110,"A family issue needs your help, so make sure that you're available when things start to heat up. You may not feel totally up for it, but this is one of those situations when you're obliged to help."
scorpio,20211111,"You're feeling a need for urgent change, so focus all that energy on one problem in your life and see what you can do to make it work. Tomorrow should be really different from today!"
scorpio,20211112,"You feel great and totally up to getting the scoop on your latest puzzle. In fact, you might go into full-on detective mode as you make your way through the day. Enjoy the search for truth!"
scorpio,20211113,"It's time to dig deeply into your bag of tricks and pull out something really spectacular. Your energy is terrific, so you ought to be able to find something that blows people's minds."
scorpio,20211114,"You are genuinely trying to help, but someone close thinks that you're trying to take advantage of the situation. You might just have to wait and let time prove you right, hard as that may be."
scorpio,20211115,"It's a bad day for fighting, even with those you can usually dominate. Just make sure that you're pushing yourself in the right direction, which ought to be away from those with axes to grind."
scorpio,20211116,"You feel thrust into an unusual situation, which is actually pretty normal for you! Adjust to the weirdness and see if you can take advantage of the incongruity."
scorpio,20211117,"If it feels hopeless today, take heart. You hold the key to success. It's not all that often that you can rely solely on yourself, but today gives you the opportunity to do just that. Take charge!"
scorpio,20211118,"Sometimes you're rigid, and then there are days like today. You can tell that if you're not flexible, things are unlikely to go your way. Bend with the wind and you're sure to succeed!"
scorpio,20211119,"You've got to deal with a financial issue that involves other people, maybe family, maybe colleagues. Your energy is a bit spread out, but you can focus it enough to make everybody happy."
scorpio,20211120,"Though you're tempted, it's not a good idea to take that risk today. It isn't that you're sure to fail but that the wrong people are watching and may not like what they see."
scorpio,20211121,"That big brain of yours is seeing some serious competition today, but you've got what it takes to shut them down. As long as you're listening to your intuition, all should go well for you."
scorpio,20211122,"Your energy level is higher than usual, and you should be able to push yourself to get almost anything done. Once you set your mind to a task, it's relatively easy to see it through to completion."
scorpio,20211123,"Try something new tonight, especially if you're going on a date. Your romantic energy is all tied up with your curiosity, and it might be easier for you to spot potential while trying a new cuisine."
scorpio,20211124,"A career problem may actually be an opportunity, but only if you're ready to think creatively. You could find that your energy is perfect for making big, bold new plans for yourself."
scorpio,20211125,This is not a good time for you to expect privileged treatment from the boss or any other authority figures. Ask for no more than you can reasonably expect to get from them. Lie low for a while.
scorpio,20211126,"Details are all-important now, so dive into that spreadsheet or ask all the right questions to make sure that you've got the answers down pat. Your mental energy helps you absorb all of it."
scorpio,20211127,"A friend in need is a friend indeed, as they say, but that doesn't mean you can't score a few points by helping out now and then. Reach out to someone you think could use a lift."
scorpio,20211128,"Today is more about others than it is about you, but it should recharge your karmic batteries, so you do end up ahead. Help where you're needed and pull back where you're not."
scorpio,20211129,"You're facing a tough choice today, but it's one you can't put off any longer. You'll probably just have to trust your gut, because it's unlikely that there's an obvious right answer. Flip a coin if you must."
scorpio,20211130,"It may seem like you're confused, but you're actually just getting extra information coming in from subconscious channels. Try not to overthink your situation. Just follow your instincts."
scorpio,20211201,"Your intensity is drawing others near, so it could get a little crowded! Your energy is perfect for socializing, though, so it should work out well. You may meet someone important."
scorpio,20211202,"Your energy and ideas are extremely attractive today, so make sure that you're spreading the word far and wide. Things might start to get tricky later, but only because you've got decisions to make."
scorpio,20211203,"You're the target of attention today, which can make you uncomfortable. There's definitely a bright side, though! You should find at least one big offer comes your way before night falls."
scorpio,20211204,"Something small that you do on impulse snowballs into a real problem at some point today. There's a bright side, though. You should find that you're better able to deal with a friend."
scorpio,20211205,"A tiny risk turns into something bigger and weirder today, but it might be an exciting opportunity! The thing is you won't know until it's too late to back out. It's entirely up to you."
scorpio,20211206,"Today is sure to settle that question on your mind about who would win in a contest of wills between you and that one friend or co-worker. It might seem petty to outsiders, but to you it's vital."
scorpio,20211207,"It's okay to be ambitious, especially with the kind of energy you've got bundled up inside today! You can make great progress as long as you don't take time to apologize for your desires."
scorpio,20211208,"You're going through some domestic problems that may not excite you, but they've got to be endured nonetheless. If you can make it through this rough patch, things should brighten considerably."
scorpio,20211209,"Your personal flow seems impeded at home, so head out of the house for fun or stay put and figure out what needs to change. You should be able to work it out, but the process won't be much fun."
scorpio,20211210,"That love buzz comes back in a big way, so get ready for a new crush or renewed passion for your sweetheart. Your amazing energy makes you as attractive as ever too, so it's certainly mutual."
scorpio,20211211,"Your creative powers are blossoming in a big way today, so write down those ideas or play with your old art supplies. You could find yourself tapping something new and exciting."
scorpio,20211212,You're quick to help someone in need without a moment's thought today. That karmic boost is exactly what you need to swing back into the right place for you spiritually.
scorpio,20211213,Someone needs you to help them without question or complaint. Are you up to the challenge? It's a great time to practice patience and try to build up your spiritual resume.
scorpio,20211214,"Your closest relationship needs some fine-tuning, so make sure that you're paying close attention to that sweetheart or best friend. What you need and what they need are in sync."
scorpio,20211215,"You have to be more open to possibilities, and today offers the chance to prove yourself. It's one of those days when things are really starting to shift. If you're flexible, you should end up ahead."
scorpio,20211216,"You need to move carefully today, especially where business is concerned. Things may not add up quite right until you look at the big picture. Try to get a new perspective as soon as you can."
scorpio,20211217,You're going about your regular daily business when you spot a small flaw that grows in importance until you can hardly think about anything else. You need to deal with it head-on.
scorpio,20211218,"Now is the time to ask for that big favor or act on your ambition. Your amazing energy is perfectly in sync with the universe as a whole, and that means you're at the right place at the right time!"
scorpio,20211219,"Your intuition is strong today, so make the most of it! Your amazing energy helps you to see clues where others just see confusion. It's the perfect time to understand that friend or sweetie."
scorpio,20211220,"A conversation takes an unexpected turn and sends you veering off into something big and weird, just how you like it! You may find that things start to get really interesting tonight."
scorpio,20211221,"Your biggest challenge has come to face you today, but it's really just an opportunity to show off! That's not to say it's easy, but you might make it look that way. The right person leaves impressed."
scorpio,20211222,"Your boss could be causing you some grief today, but it's not a good time to complain or retaliate. You can get back into balance in the near future, but for now you have to persevere."
scorpio,20211223,"A big secret spills today, and while it may have nothing to do with you at first, eventually it seeps into your awareness in a big way. You may be able to take advantage of this!"
scorpio,20211224,"A good friend needs to check in with you. Are you ready for it? Expect big news, though it may be the sort of news that you just have to pretend to be shocked by. Things settle down soon."
scorpio,20211225,New information comes your way that makes you wonder what's what. Things should start to make a lot more sense once you get tonight's addendum. Ask the right questions while you're at it.
scorpio,20211226,"Your subliminal messages are finally getting received, but the answers might be hard to understand. That's all part of the game, so just see if you can glide along based on pure intuition."
scorpio,20211227,"Something or someone is slipping from your fingers, but it's for the best. It might be frustrating or worse for a little while, but you will soon see that this is how it's supposed to be."
scorpio,20211228,"Your strength is tested late in the day, but your great personal energy ensures that you pass with flying colors! If you're in the right place, this could be the opportunity you've been looking for."
scorpio,20211229,"Early today, you're struck by a vision of what could be that leaves you almost deliriously happy. Of course, you've got to work to get there, but that's not so hard for one such as yourself."
scorpio,20211230,You feel reborn as old issues just fade away and you embrace the new energy you can feel flowing from somewhere down deep. It's a great time for you to step up to a new challenge.
scorpio,20211231,"Someone is tempting you to take a risk of some kind, probably emotional, but possibly financial or even physical. This is not the time to play such games, so decline as politely as you can."
scorpio,20220101,You are feeling pretty weird today. Something is just too good to be true! Make sure that you're expressing this skepticism openly so you can either get to the truth or convince others you're right.
sagittarius,20210101,"It's your lucky day! That could mean you get a great parking space or it could be much bigger, but don't gamble anything you can't afford to lose! That's good advice any day, but don't let cockiness defeat you."
sagittarius,20210102,"Just one smile can make your day today, even if it's yours! Make a point of being pleasant and cheerful all day and you should see a huge return on your investment. Things should improve steadily!"
sagittarius,20210103,"You could butt heads with an authority figure today, so only push them as much as they can take or they could turn on you with a vengeance. Your judgment is key."
sagittarius,20210104,"Try not to rush too far ahead of yourself today. Things are complex enough already! You might have to get a friend to help hold you back, at least a little, as your instincts are to keep moving quickly."
sagittarius,20210105,"Laughter seems to surround you today, but not mockery! You should do what you can to keep it going, but with your terrific energy, it shouldn't take much of an effort this time."
sagittarius,20210106,"Communication is key today. Things are going well, but you're sure to improve them even more with a few well-placed words. A quick e-mail or impromptu meeting can make a big difference!"
sagittarius,20210107,"You might feel the need for some alone time, so go right ahead and take it. You probably deserve it, and it's likely that you need the mental space to keep everything straight."
sagittarius,20210108,"Your imagination is your most potent asset today, so make sure that you're using it like a boss. That could mean derailing old plans or starting out in a bold new direction, but so be it!"
sagittarius,20210109,"Your satisfaction is showing. People can sense your positive spirit, and they most likely want to get closer. It's a really good time for you to show what you are capable of."
sagittarius,20210110,"Your energy is still flowing strongly, and you ought to be able to get your people to share your spirit of exploration. Try an activity that's always been out of reach."
sagittarius,20210111,"Things are a little weird today, but that can be an adventure! Make sure that you're not just trying to deal with something that isn't an actual problem, though. In fact, you might want to let things slide."
sagittarius,20210112,"Can you make it through the day without spending any money? If so, you're perfectly in sync with your non-material focus. Don't take part. But if you must, try to get as good a deal as you can. "
sagittarius,20210113,Now is a great time for you to step up your efforts to plan for the future. It's one of those days when you can tell that every penny you save is sure to be well spent at some time down the line.
sagittarius,20210114,"You are exploring new territory today, so make sure that you keep your eyes open. Expect one major find that could surprise you."
sagittarius,20210115,"You are in a great place today, but that means that you're probably at the center of too many different obligations. If you have to say no, you can at least say it respectfully."

sagittarius,20210118,"You're having so much fun today that it feels like life is a game. You might as well treat it as such as long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process. If they take it seriously, so should you (a little)."
sagittarius,20210119,"If you've got kids, they need you more than ever today. If not, you should keep an eye out for nearby young ones and see that they can teach you. With your great energy, it's sure to be vital!"
sagittarius,20210120,"Today is all about responsibility for you, which can feel like a drag but may actually be quite liberating! Once you've crossed off that last task, you can revel in your newfound freedom!"
sagittarius,20210121,"You need to force yourself into something like discipline today or you're never going to get anything done, and then tomorrow will just be more of the same. Do what you must."
sagittarius,20210122,"You aren't feeling the same level of ennui your peers are today. In fact, you may be the only one who isn't dying from boredom! Just try to rouse them with your own passion and see what happens."
sagittarius,20210123,"You can't stop talking about the next big thing even if that means you never get around to dealing with it! That's fine, because today is all about discussion and planning, not taking direct action."
sagittarius,20210124,"Your philosophical leanings are enhanced now, but don't expect any major breakthroughs! Sometimes the intellectual journey is more important than the destination. Enjoy it for what it is."
sagittarius,20210125,"Your philosophical understanding deepens today, though that might not be of any practical value. Who cares? You're wiser, and that should be its own reward. Someday it may pay off."
sagittarius,20210126,"You are certainly an idealist, and it really shows on a day like today, but it's too bad there's so little you can do to push your beliefs forward. At least you can make a stand and show the world who you are."
sagittarius,20210127,"Can you really have too much of a good thing? Yes, sometimes, but not today! You seem to have exactly what you need in exactly the amount you need, so make sure things are moving forward."
sagittarius,20210128,"You've got certain advantages over other people that sometimes feel unfair, but you need to make the most of them today. Your terrific energy is just the start of the list, so work your way down."
sagittarius,20210129,"You should be traveling! If you can't, then at least start to make plans for your next great getaway. Your terrific energy is just right for taking the next step. Things should be ready for you soon."
sagittarius,20210130,"You don't know why, but you're having a harder time dealing with authority today. Try to level the playing field if possible, or at least question the rules of play."
sagittarius,20210131,"Try not to worry too much about how fast you're getting things done. You need to make sure that you're getting them done right. That could mean slowing way down, but it's vital."
sagittarius,20210201,"Your friends are sending you all their love today, even if your life is perfectly in balance. Soak it all up and make sure to let them know that you are right there with them too."
sagittarius,20210202,"You might be especially drawn to one idea today. Planting a seed now could lead to big developments later. Your mood should be fairly buoyant throughout the day, so enjoy it!"
sagittarius,20210203,"Your dreams are spinning new ideas into your mind, but at a pace that isn't quite keeping up with the rest of the world. There's nothing wrong with that! Just keep on dreaming for now."
sagittarius,20210204,"Your moody side is out in force now, so make sure you're not pushing your people too hard. It might be a good time to withdraw for a bit and focus on your interior situation."
sagittarius,20210205,"Turn inward and think hard about what you really want. Your energy is not meant for external use on a day like today, so focus on your spirituality and emotional nature and see what pops up."
sagittarius,20210206,"Friendship is key to your success, however you choose to define it. Make sure that you're throwing yourself into your relationships with no thought of self-preservation for now."
sagittarius,20210207,"You admire a friend or colleague for their hidden qualities, so let them know you can see what they're best at. You may find that things start to get a little easier between you."
sagittarius,20210208,"You've got your own way of seeing things and saying things. At least one person seriously admires your bravery, but someone else doesn't care for your personal point of view."
sagittarius,20210209,"There's no need to beat around the bush. What you've got to say can be said better directly. If someone close gets uncomfortable, that's on them. Open up and wait for a measured response."
sagittarius,20210210,"Now is the time to let your people know what's really happening. Post something for all to see, send out an e-mail blast, or just call up all your people in alphabetical order. Communication is everything!"
sagittarius,20210211,Try not to worry too much about your people. You've got enough to worry about! Now is a good time to focus on meeting new folks and interacting with those you'd never ordinarily say hi to.
sagittarius,20210212,"It's one of those days that feels like a week, especially in the morning! You just can't seem to get revved up to meet the day no matter what you try, so just shrug it off and do what you can."
sagittarius,20210213,"This isn't a great time to launch new projects or try to generate momentum. You're slowed down by a thousand tiny obligations. Take care of as many of them as you can, and things may speed up tomorrow."
sagittarius,20210214,"You are a powerhouse today! Your amazing energy helps you start new things, surprise the hotties with smooth moves, and even get yourself that raise or promotion you've been wanting."
sagittarius,20210215,"You're having so much fun that you might not even realize how much you're getting done. By the end of the day, though, you should understand that things go better with a smile on your face."
sagittarius,20210216,"Your communication style is dominant, so talk yourself up! You can make a real difference when it comes to your career or love life because you can speak clearly and from the heart."
sagittarius,20210217,"It's the little stuff that makes your life more interesting, so dive into the details even if they seem boring at first. You are sure to learn more and more about what's really going on."
sagittarius,20210218,
sagittarius,20210219,"You're close to a breakthrough mentally, but you're not quite there. Keep pushing. Today's energy is perfect for philosophizing, but don't expect the epiphany to come quite yet."
sagittarius,20210220,"Things are up in the air in a big way, but that just means you can have a greater effect on where they land! Get out there, show the team what you've got, and you can expect a great success."
sagittarius,20210221,"You and a friend or colleague are at odds with each other, but it all turns out to be a big misunderstanding. See if you can just ride this phase out. The situation doesn't clear up for a few days."
sagittarius,20210222,Your energy is wildly off base today when compared with that of a good friend or close ally at work. You just have to deal with it. Sometimes you can't count on your social ties to really connect.
sagittarius,20210223,"It's time to show how flexible you can be, so make sure that you're dealing with the world as it really is, not how you wish it could be. Things are sure to get better as soon as your attitude adjusts."
sagittarius,20210224,You need to figure out a way to deal with a situation that's in dire need of an upgrade. The good news is that your amazing energy can help you find sneaky ways to get what you need.
sagittarius,20210225,"Is this your lucky day? It depends on what you need and what you count as luck. If you're single, you may bump into your next flame. If you need work, you may discover a hidden talent."
sagittarius,20210226,"Try to focus on the details today. They are more important than usual. While they might start to feel like they're dragging you down, they're really keeping you grounded."
sagittarius,20210227,"Someone you usually like is starting to drive you crazy, but this isn't a long-term problem. Try to just be pleasant and let them natter on while you work on your own projects."
sagittarius,20210228,"This is a great day to focus on your own needs, those that you can handle yourself, that is. Don't rely on others until tomorrow at the earliest, and try not to ask for any special favors."
sagittarius,20210301,"Your big laugh is a joy to hear today, and you've got lots of reasons to deploy it! Focus your energy on friends and colleagues and others you really trust."
sagittarius,20210302,Now is the best possible time to communicate with friends and family. Your social energy is perfect for even the toughest conversation. Things are looking up for you and your people!
sagittarius,20210303,"It's a great day to hang out on your own and deal with personal business. Your energy is building, but it's unlikely to reach a peak for a few more days. You can get through this."
sagittarius,20210304,"Your imaginative side is out in force, though you may not be able to make much practical use of it. There's nothing wrong with that. Just dream up a few new ideas and wait to get to work on them."
sagittarius,20210305,"Your happy button gets pushed early and often today, so enjoy it! You may find that you've got pleasant surprises coming at you every hour or so, and you should pass them along to friends."

sagittarius,20210307,"Things could be a little weird today, but that doesn't mean that you should double down on eccentricity! Just make sure that you're keeping abreast of new developments and you're able to see things clearly."
sagittarius,20210308,"Things are looking good for you as long as you can hold back on spending! Your personal energy also needs to be reined in a bit, so make sure that you're moderate in all things."
sagittarius,20210309,"You need to stretch beyond your typical boundaries. Your mental energy is fresh and clear, and you can see new and exciting possibilities awaiting you just ahead."
sagittarius,20210310,"Your social relationships are much more interesting than usual now, so make the most of them! It's one of those great days when you can feel your network strengthening your position."
sagittarius,20210311,"You need to go beyond past barriers, which is easier said than done, of course. Things may get uncomfortable while you get used to your new surroundings, but it's well worth it!"
sagittarius,20210312,"You are thinking things through instead of taking action, which feels difficult but may still yield good results. You should be able to get to the bottom of whatever is blocking your progress."
sagittarius,20210313,"You're playing games with someone, but not in a bad way! If anything, this feels like a fun rivalry taken to a new level. Make the most of it and see how far you can run with things this time."
sagittarius,20210314,"Harness some of your enthusiasm and direct it in a positive, productive way. What do you most want to accomplish? Your creativity is one of your best assets. "
sagittarius,20210315,Your energy is a force of nature and you're practically unstoppable today! It's a good time for you to push ahead with your plans and ignore the opposition. They're almost powerless!
sagittarius,20210316,"Face up to your responsibilities today. They're not going anywhere, and you need to make sure that you at least look like you're taking them seriously. You can get back to the fun stuff in a few days."
sagittarius,20210317,"Try to tackle your daily tasks before checking e-mail, going on social media, or doing any other fun stuff. It's not as exciting, sure, but once your basic needs are met, you should be able to kick back."
sagittarius,20210318,"You feel excited about something that nobody else seems to even notice. You can keep it to yourself or try to spread the word, but it may just be you who sees this as something big!"
sagittarius,20210319,"It's a day of talk, not action. That may get frustrating after a while, but you should find that your energy is best spent in meetings or interviews, hard as that may be to believe."
sagittarius,20210320,"You are thinking hard about some issue of major importance to you, but you're not getting anywhere! That's okay, though. Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination."
sagittarius,20210321,"Spend time patching up a relationship in dire need of repair. Your energy isn't all that great for work, but it's terrific when it comes to friends or family. Things can get so much better!"
sagittarius,20210322,"Your philosophical bent is in full effect today, so you should do whatever it takes to apply your brain to all problems. You might not get anywhere practical, but you should learn quite a bit."

sagittarius,20210325,"Your terrific energy is making life fun for those around you. Expect to see more positivity than usual around you, if for no other reason than that you're radiating it yourself. Keep it up!"
sagittarius,20210326,"You have to wrangle authority today, yours or someone else's. It's not easy, and it's certainly not fun, but it is vital. Once you're past this phase, things start to speed up in a good way."
sagittarius,20210327,"Slow down! You're moving too quickly, even if it doesn't feel that way. It's far too easy for you to skip over vital steps in the process and end up further behind than you can afford to be."
sagittarius,20210328,"Someone sees you as a mentor today, so make sure that they get the advice they need and not just what they want to hear. It's one of those days when your wisdom is at its peak."
sagittarius,20210329,"Your desires and ambitions are closer to reality than you may realize, but you can't bring them fully to life without talking about them with your people. Sit down and get the ball rolling."
sagittarius,20210330,"Your subconscious mind is hyperactive right now, which is both good and bad. You might have a few wild brainstorms that thrill you, but at the same time you could come across as a bit loony!"
sagittarius,20210331,"Think about why things are happening today. Otherwise, you're sure to get lost in the details! Your energy needs some support in order to make it through the maze of weirdness that surrounds you."

sagittarius,20210403,It's time for you to rethink your core values. What's really going on under the surface? You may find it easier to deal with those close to you if you make the process explicit.
sagittarius,20210404,You could find yourself pulling back from the radical plan that seemed so appealing just a few days ago. Sometimes you've got to weigh both sides of your personality against each other to make a decision.
sagittarius,20210405,"You need to open yourself up to new ideas, which isn't really all that hard for you. Still, if you don't do it soon, things could get tough, so make sure that you're focusing on the wider world."
sagittarius,20210406,"Your social energy is strong now, and you're almost certainly in the right place at the right time to take advantage of new opportunities. Speak clearly and directly and things should go well for you."
sagittarius,20210407,It's a great time for you to connect with others who've been around the block even if you feel like the wisest one in the room. Try to just hang back and listen to what they have to say.
sagittarius,20210408,"Sometimes all you need is a good story to tide you over between high points. For now, you've got some spiritual work to do (whether you know it or not), so adopt a heroic figure and try to emulate them."
sagittarius,20210409,"You've accumulated some wisdom over the past few days, and now is the time to assemble it into something you can use in real life. It's work, but it's certainly worthwhile!"

sagittarius,20210411,"You're filled with great creative energy and should be able to bat new ideas back and forth over and over again. It's a great day to impress the boss with a bold, new plan for future growth."
sagittarius,20210412,"You can deal with any crazy issue that pops up today, but you have to believe in yourself! Things are better than you realize even if this snafu looks like the end of the world."
sagittarius,20210413,"You're feeling the urge to save the world again. It's one of those days when helping others feels like a big priority, so make sure that you're focused on opportunities for altruism."
sagittarius,20210414,"You need to be wary of those around you. You're not in physical danger, but they're mostly looking out for themselves. Do the same and you can get back to normal that much sooner!"
sagittarius,20210415,"If you don't have enough to do, make up some busywork for yourself. You need to stay active because your energy is sure to vanish if you take much time to rest or even just daydream."
sagittarius,20210416,"You could have so much going on today that you have to prioritize. That isn't so hard, but at least one person is sure to be unhappy with a choice you make. Give them time to chat (tomorrow)."
sagittarius,20210417,"You have to dive in deeply wherever your mood and instincts lead. It might get pretty messy, but that just means that things need to be adjusted quickly. You should do just fine!"
sagittarius,20210418,"You crave depth, and you should find it in just the right places. Things don't feel quite right, but once you settle into the philosophical or emotional trenches, you should find it all makes sense."
sagittarius,20210419,"Your devotion to a cause or person is magnified today, and that makes life that much sweeter for everyone involved! You may find that you've got twice as much energy as usual."
sagittarius,20210420,"You reach a new pinnacle today, and it's one that should make life both more interesting and more challenging. Keep striving ever upward and see where it leads you. Things are getting interesting!"
sagittarius,20210421,Your great energy is driving you to seek new experiences. Today is perfect for picking a random activity or moving outside your comfort zone.
sagittarius,20210422,"People are driving you nuts today. That's fine! It happens to everyone sometimes, and you may find it best to just walk away and spend time on your own. Things should settle down pretty soon."
sagittarius,20210423,"It's a time of giving, so try not to ask for any more than you've already gotten. Give of yourself and your karmic meter should start to refill pretty quickly. That's a win for everyone!"
sagittarius,20210424,You feel totally drawn into some strange issue in a way that never occurred to you before. Your family may think you've turned into a lawyer (or judge or prophet) by the time today is over.
sagittarius,20210425,"Today is all about fairness, so try to make sure that you treat everyone equally. Things could get out of control if you're not there to referee, so be sure to stay in the thick of things."
sagittarius,20210426,"Your sense of justice may be offended at first today, but you can bring the situation back into balance if you're direct and speak plainly to the right people. Keep pushing for what you believe!"
sagittarius,20210427,"You've got to deal with the big picture today or you're sure to freak out when things start to get crazy. If you see where you're headed, you can likely make decent progress."
sagittarius,20210428,"This is not a day for social activities. You are unusually introverted. That probably just means you've got to recharge your batteries, so take some time to yourself and get your second wind."
sagittarius,20210429,"You find yourself looking forward to something with giddy anticipation. Your energy is great, but just try to keep you mind on your work for now."
sagittarius,20210430,Your amazing personal energy is driving you to explore your world. It's a good time to hang out with old pals or meet new people!
sagittarius,20210501,"Try to save more money for the next few months. You have the willpower and the motivation to make every dollar count, but you have to start now!"
sagittarius,20210502,"This isn't the best time for you to shop. You are prone to impulsive behavior, and you could end up with some serious buyer's remorse. Tidy up your house or dive into a work project instead."
sagittarius,20210503,"Try to get back in touch with that old friend or estranged relative. Things are shakier than you may realize, and your voice could be just what they need to turn things around and make life better."
sagittarius,20210504,"Your brain is buzzing with excitement. New ideas are flooding through it, and you're putting all the pieces together in a new way. It's a good time to make plans, so get down to business some other day."
sagittarius,20210505,"Break down those walls! You can cross boundaries with ease, and you should be able to expand your reach in new and unusual ways. Enjoy the opportunity, but try to find time to rest too."
sagittarius,20210506,"You're not feeling quite as active as usual, but there's nothing wrong with that. If anything, it should give you more time to think about what you'll do with all the energy coming your way soon."
sagittarius,20210507,"You might need to deal with kids today, maybe yours, maybe a friend's, or maybe some random screamers. Whatever it is, try to tap into your great personal energy to accept the world on their terms. It's more fun!"
sagittarius,20210508,"Your energy is incredible today, almost aggressive! That could get you in trouble if you're not in the right place at the right time, so make sure those around you can handle what you've got."
sagittarius,20210509,"Today is all about the small stuff, which, you may remember, you shouldn't sweat. Still, you do have to address all the details of today's plan or project, so get a handle on them and then get to work!"
sagittarius,20210510,"Can you keep two separate points of view straight in your head today? It should help quite a bit if you can, and you should find that your people pull you in the right direction if you veer off course."
sagittarius,20210511,"There's nothing you can't handle today. Your energy may be a bit unfocused, but you can still cope with the details of your new situation. A friend helps you reorganize to make things even better!"
sagittarius,20210512,"You could be frustrated with the lack of activity around you, but listen carefully! A lot of what sounds like idle chatter is actually concealing some seriously smart ideas."
sagittarius,20210513,"You should try to carve out some time for deep thought today, but don't expect to change the world. If you explore your philosophy, that may be its own reward."
sagittarius,20210514,"You feel a bit of a mismatch between you and a friend or colleague, but this isn't the day to repair it! In fact, if you go your separate ways for a bit, it's likely to just take care of itself."
sagittarius,20210515,"You and your partner (or date or pal) are seemingly at odds, but it's just temporary. Don't read too much into it. Try to just chill out and let time pass."
sagittarius,20210516,"You're not always the most flexible person in the world, but today you need to extend yourself a bit. Things are good, but they could be even better if you can adapt to match them."
sagittarius,20210517,"Your energy is perking up dramatically today, and communication is easier and more fluid than ever. Take this opportunity to reach out to potential employers or anyone else you want to impress."
sagittarius,20210518,"Can you get out of town? If not, don't worry about it, but if you can hit the road or at least make plans to travel far away, your place in the world will get a lot better."
sagittarius,20210519,"Someone in charge is causing problems for you. There is really no way around it, so you might just have to pretend that everything is all fine with you (for now)."
sagittarius,20210520,"Try not to get too far ahead of yourself. Things are changing too quickly for even you to catch up! As long as you can find a way to muddle through the day, things should start to look up soon."
sagittarius,20210521,"You've got to handle the details of whatever is going on today. Nobody else is equipped to do so! That might be kind of a drag, but you should be able to push through it and then get to the fun stuff."
sagittarius,20210522,"Others are looking to you for leadership and guidance today, so step up and show them what you've got! It's easy for you to see what needs to happen so all you need to do is articulate your vision."
sagittarius,20210523,"The best thing you can do today is speak out. Your energy is strong, but you're more likely to win support by explaining than by pressuring. Keep the peace and all should go well for you."
sagittarius,20210524,
sagittarius,20210525,"A dream has a special message for you. Are you ready to listen? Even if you're sure you didn't dream last night, the signal has been received, so watch out for subconscious changes."
sagittarius,20210526,"You either make a new friend or take a current friendship to a new level today. Your energy is undeniable, and others are drawn to you. Romance may be in the air, but it's not your sole focus."
sagittarius,20210527,"Your admiration for a friend or family member shines brightly today, and it pays off too! Hand out compliments freely and you may find that the gratitude comes back to you quickly."
sagittarius,20210528,Cooking and other domestic activities hold special appeal for you today. Spend as much time as you can at home and store up that peace and goodwill for later when you'll need it more.
sagittarius,20210529,"It's a good time for reflection. Your energy is turned inward somewhat, and you may find that you're starting to question one or more core values. Let yourself drift and see where you end up."
sagittarius,20210530,"You've got to communicate today if you want to make any kind of progress. Things could get a little hectic when messages start piling up, but it's all for the best."
sagittarius,20210531,"It might be tempting to roll your eyes when those around you trot out their wildest ideas, but you should be able to suspend your disbelief long enough to absorb the one that might just work."
sagittarius,20210601,"It's one of those days when you seem to be immune to caffeine. The morning may slog on for too long, but you should eventually get yourself roused enough to tackle the day's major business."
sagittarius,20210602,"This isn't a day for progress, but you can at least keep yourself from sliding backward. Things are looking up for you and yours, but first you've got to make it past this long, slow day."
sagittarius,20210603,You've got so much energy that you may be at a loss for what to do with it all. See if you can get your people to back off so you can get the time and space you need to move forward quickly.
sagittarius,20210604,"You need to have fun if you want to get anything done today, and fortunately, you have terrific energy and an even better mood! Make a game out of the boring stuff so you can get it done faster."

sagittarius,20210607,You need to analyze this situation before taking action even if you have to think all day! It's just a good time for you to take a step back and check out what the rest of the world sees.
sagittarius,20210608,"You're focused on the big picture to the exclusion of all else, but you can't quite take it all in at once. You can still make amazing progress if you push yourself, but clarity comes later."
sagittarius,20210609,The situation all comes down to you. What are you willing to do to bring about a happy ending? Your energy resonates with the situation in a way that makes you the key player.
sagittarius,20210610,"You and a friend or co-worker are at odds, but it most likely isn't a sign of any serious conflict. You're just out of sync, so try to back away until things start to feel better."
sagittarius,20210611,"Your energy isn't quite on par with someone else's, and that could cause some problems if you are forced into close proximity. See if you can de-escalate the situation until you're both at the same level."
sagittarius,20210612,You need to adjust to the situation. You can't just barrel through on your own this time. It's easier than you may realize to get past these obstacles if you give it a little thought.
sagittarius,20210613,"The urge to see the world strikes again! Your energy is terrific, so you shouldn't have a hard time imagining a destination. Getting there may be tricky, but you can do it if you start planning now."
sagittarius,20210614,"Some aspect of your life suddenly gets a lot better, and it should stay that way! You may have upgraded your love life or your career, but you can expect the benefits to stick around for a good long time."
sagittarius,20210615,"You have to deal with your antiauthoritarian streak before it gets you in trouble! It's a short-term situation, but it's one that could cause some heartbreak if you mouth off at the wrong time."
sagittarius,20210616,"Try not to move too quickly today. Things are getting weird, and you may find that slowing down actually helps you move out of this phase a little faster. Patience is a serious virtue!"
sagittarius,20210617,"It's the little details that matter most for the time being, so get out your reading glasses and really pore over the fine print. You may find something oddly delightful buried in the legalese."
sagittarius,20210618,Your people are backing you up all the way even if they had their doubts yesterday. Move forward with confidence. You can expect support no matter how things go.
sagittarius,20210619,"Today is all about groups and socializing. Try to collaborate if you're working or doing chores, and make sure that you're not spending too much time on your own. People energize you!"
sagittarius,20210620,"Your dream state is really interesting these days, though that doesn't mean you should just sleep all day long! Try to absorb the best information from the depths and relate it to your waking world."
sagittarius,20210621,"You feel moodier than usual today, which is likely an indicator that you need to spend time alone. Even the most extroverted people require occasional downtime, so shut the door for a while."
sagittarius,20210622,Try to figure out what's going on. Things may be weirder than you realize. It's especially important for you to figure out what's going on down deep in your subconscious. This is a turning point!

sagittarius,20210624,"Try not to get too wrapped up in ego issues, but it would be hard to miss the waves of admiration coming your way today. At work, at school, or in the neighborhood, people are taking notice of your best features."
sagittarius,20210625,You need to express yourself more clearly or you're sure to fall behind today. Don't worry about your latest shenanigans. You have to be true to yourself to make things happen.
sagittarius,20210626,"Your way of seeing the world is clear, forceful, and direct. Today brings a new chance to convert others to your cause as long as you go about it plainly. Subterfuge just isn't your style!"

sagittarius,20210630,You need to think things through today or you could find yourself dealing with unintended consequences for weeks. A little planning is sure to go a long way.
sagittarius,20210701,"You're playing life like it's a game, and not that silly one with the pink pegs you played as a kid. Have fun with today's terrific energy and see if you can convince other players to join your team!"
sagittarius,20210702,"Kids are important to you today, so make sure that you're either spending time with yours or otherwise finding opportunities to unleash your inner child. Life doesn't have to be dull!"
sagittarius,20210703,Your responsibilities are important today -- even more so than usual! See if you can get your people to take care of their own business so you can focus on the chores and tasks that take precedence.
sagittarius,20210704,"Even if you desperately don't want to do it, that one big task has to be completed today. Find it within yourself to tackle this issue before it spirals out of control into something big and weird."
sagittarius,20210705,You're far from bored today -- even if you're stuck in the same old place. Something has fired up your brain and keeps new ideas working their way through you all day long. Have fun!
sagittarius,20210706,"Someone close is talking a good game -- but you know they can't back it up when things start to get real. Make sure that you're supportive, but try to let them know they need to tone it down a bit."
sagittarius,20210707,"You need to think hard about some big issue that means a lot to you -- but don't expect to hit on a solution right away! Your mental energy is good, but these things take time and patience."
sagittarius,20210708,Your relationships are key to your mood and success today -- so reach out to anyone who's estranged or who has been causing stress. You can repair almost anything if you're sincere.
sagittarius,20210709,"A philosophical difference may bring other, deeper issues to a head today -- but conflict can be good! In fact, you may find that you and your opponent end up arriving at the same place together."
sagittarius,20210710,"Your creative side is fully active now -- so make some art or surprise your sweetie with something spontaneous. You're as impressive as you've ever been, so make the most of it!"
sagittarius,20210711,"You're in the middle of a burst of good luck! It's not time to lay down massive bets, but it is a good time to takes risks at work or in your love life. The odds are on your side, and you can't win if you don't play. Share the good fortune with others."

sagittarius,20210713,"You butt heads with your boss, teacher or some other authority figure who's not willing to listen to reason. They're likely to come out ahead, but you may be able to claim a small victory."
sagittarius,20210714,"This is not a good time to make haste -- your energy is better parceled out in small doses. In fact, if you try to rush ahead, you'll almost certainly need to backtrack to correct mistakes."
sagittarius,20210715,Your easy laugh and cheery mood makes life sweeter for everyone around you today -- so open up and make sure that you're showing everyone just how to make it through life with a smile.
sagittarius,20210716,"You can take care of even the most difficult conversations with ease today, so open up and get your people talking. Almost anything is fair game, and you should walk away from it all feeling good."
sagittarius,20210717,You may want to hang out on your own today -- and there's nothing wrong with that! It's one of those days when you're sure to find that you get more done with your door closed and your ringer off.
sagittarius,20210718,It's a great day for figuring out some new creative avenues to explore -- but not so much for the exploration. Get out the (metaphorical) map and compass and plot your course.
sagittarius,20210719,You may hear that little voice in your head again -- but you're not going nuts! It's just one of those days when your subconscious is taking the reins a little more than usual. Follow its lead!
sagittarius,20210720,Something strikes you early today that brings a smile to your face -- and almost nothing can take it away from you. Make sure that you're sharing your good mood and good fortune with the world!

sagittarius,20210723,"Your energy is a bit out of sync today, but you can correct it by pinching off your cash flow. Don't cash that check quite yet unless you're near insolvency, and certainly don't buy anything you can live without."
sagittarius,20210724,"It's time for you to get moving! Your energy is restless, and you typically turn that into a drive for exploration. It may be time for a road trip, or you could just try out that one new nightspot."

sagittarius,20210729,"Your productivity is sky-high right now, so make sure that you're pushing yourself to new heights. Things aren't going to keep up this way for much longer, and you need to take advantage of it."
sagittarius,20210730,"This is a great day for communication -- and not just because everyone's expecting to get pranked! Your energy is great for pitches, mash notes or just plain old boring correspondence."
sagittarius,20210731,"It's the small stuff that really counts today -- so make sure that you're paying attention! Details can be boring, sure, but your energy actually helps you cope with that kind of minute work."

sagittarius,20210803,It's all up to you today -- so make sure that you're ready for action! You are sure to make a real difference as you make your way through the day. Things are bound to shape up by the time night falls.

sagittarius,20210807,"A surprise upgrade or other kind of improvement brightens your day -- and it could come at any time. You may find yourself up in first class, dating that new crush or even promoted to a new job."
sagittarius,20210808,"A lucky break early in the day gives you the momentum you need to get it all done early. That gives you extra time to do with as you please, so make the most of this great energy and have fun!"
sagittarius,20210809,"You need to avoid the temptation to tell off your boss -- or someone else in a position of power over you. It's a great day for working solo, actually, though you may not have that option."
sagittarius,20210810,"Try not to run too fast today -- it's too easy to lose ground thanks to skipping steps. If you can maintain a relatively steady pace, you should be fine in the long run. Don't worry about lost time!"
sagittarius,20210811,"Your friends are all-important today, and they may surprise you with support and love and all the rest of the awesome package. Enjoy the day, as this kind of social well-being doesn't happen all the time."
sagittarius,20210812,"It's all about group activities today, so make sure that you're paying attention to those around you. If you're working, make sure you can collaborate; if not, ring up a friend to hang out."
sagittarius,20210813,"Today brings news from someone you know, but not well. It may be that you're being approached about a job or that you need to get back in touch with a friend of a friend regarding something important."
sagittarius,20210814,A dream bearing a significant message comes your way tonight -- so do what you can to remember it! Keep a journal by the bed or just let the information soak into your subconscious.
sagittarius,20210815,"You are feeling a bit down today, but not so much that you need special attention or medication. It's just one of those times when your batteries need a recharge before you can get going."

sagittarius,20210819,"Your direct manner is both shocking and approachable -- people know just what they're getting from you. Don't hold back, and try not to let anyone off the hook if they say or do anything dumb."
sagittarius,20210820,"Your ability to communicate is greatly linked to your energy today -- and it's a good thing that your energy levels are so high! You can make yourself understood with great ease, so make a point of it."

sagittarius,20210822,"It's hard to get out of bed today -- do you really have to, or can you just bury yourself under the sheets all day long? If you must face the day, try to put off any appointments until next week."
sagittarius,20210823,This isn't the best day for beginnings -- you should experience slow starts and not much progress until tomorrow or the day after that. It's a good time to just keep doing what you have been doing.
sagittarius,20210824,"You misplace something early today that might elude you until tonight or even later. Don't worry too much about it -- the harder you look, the less likely you are to just stumble upon it."
sagittarius,20210825,"Your energy levels just can't be beat today -- so take advantage of the situation and make sure that you're out and as active as possible. Things are looking up, but you can make them even better!"
sagittarius,20210826,You are getting so much done that you feel like a walking productivity seminar. Your great mood caps off a great day and makes you look forward to more of the same coming up soon!
sagittarius,20210827,"Ignore the big picture, at least for today -- you need to take care of the small stuff. Details matter more now than they have in quite some time, so make sure they all line up in the right direction."
sagittarius,20210828,"Your wild spirituality can wait for one more day -- you need to focus on mundane stuff like cooking, cleaning and paying the bills. Once that stuff is out of the way, you can return to inner space."
sagittarius,20210829,What are you doing with your life? Now is the time to deal with that one issue that has been haunting you -- and your energy is just right for handling whatever havoc it has been wreaking.
sagittarius,20210830,"Interpersonal relations are a bit difficult today -- but not so much that you can't manage them handily. Things should get a little easier as the day goes on, but you should still try to keep calm."
sagittarius,20210831,"You have got to be as flexible as possible today -- otherwise, you may find that you've got even more work ahead of you tomorrow. Things are definitely getting better, but it takes time."
sagittarius,20210901,Your emotions are your best guide to what's real and what's not today -- so make sure that you're in touch with how you really feel and can get the freedom to act on that knowledge. It's worth it!
sagittarius,20210902,"Even if you have your doubts, you need to go in deep today -- otherwise, things are sure to get weirder and weirder for you as the day progresses. Half measures just won't do for you."
sagittarius,20210903,"You need some travel in your life. If you can sneak away for a quick road trip, go for it. If not, plan for something big and extravagant and see when you can break away for a good long time."
sagittarius,20210904,"Your devotion to friends is a real asset, and today you can improve their lives and your own at the same time. Things are sure to get better in the near future, too, but keep focused outward."
sagittarius,20210905,"Details are everything right now, so make sure that you're really checking them over. You may find that it's easier for you to enlist support than it is to just tackle it all yourself, though."
sagittarius,20210906,You are more irritable than ever right now -- but you can solve that problem as easily as shutting a door or taking a walk. Get away from people for a bit and you should feel much better.
sagittarius,20210907,"This is not the best time to persuade other people -- in fact, you may send them packing if you come on too strong. Just let them do what they're going to do and then come at them another day."
sagittarius,20210908,"A legal issue may require a professional sometime soon -- so now is a good time to shop around for an attorney, if you don't have one already. Don't panic! It shouldn't be a big deal in the end."
sagittarius,20210909,"Can you bear to witness the latest example of deep unfairness in your world? It may take all you've got to make things right, but only you have the leverage needed to take care of this."
sagittarius,20210910,"It's a low-key day for you -- and you may snap at someone if they start to pester you too much. Try not to offend anyone, but sometimes your mood is simply beyond your control."
sagittarius,20210911,"Self-awareness is a strong suit for you today, though you may not like everything you see. Just observe your own behavior and decide later how (or if) to address the stuff you don't care for."
sagittarius,20210912,"Your mood is quite sweet, and you should find that your energy is almost perfect for any social situation you run across. You may also find that someone new is drawn to you in a lovely way."

sagittarius,20210919,"Your thoughtful mental energy is a tremendous help today, because there are so many odd details that need to be sorted out. You should start to see a pattern emerge by the end of the day."

sagittarius,20210921,"You may find that you're getting even more done than you had expected -- and with energy this potent, it's no wonder! You're also having fun, even if the work is pure drudgery."
sagittarius,20210922,"Your love life is really taking off -- in one way or another. Maybe you have a new crush, or maybe your long-term partner is stepping up their game and really making life sweeter."
sagittarius,20210923,"You can't help it -- the details are just jumping out at you! Even though you'd rather broaden your view, there's just no way for you to keep from narrowing down until you've found the source of the problem."
sagittarius,20210924,"If you start to panic today, remember this: there's nothing that happens today that you can't handle. Your energy may not be as tightly focused as usual, but you can still deal with anything."
sagittarius,20210925,"It's vital that you stay as busy as possible today, or you may find yourself doing slightly crazy things, thanks to boredom or anxiety. A steady stream of activity keeps you sane."
sagittarius,20210926,"You've got a lot going on today -- but not so much that you can't squeeze a few extra meetings or activities into your schedule. In fact, you are better off keeping it filled to the brim."
sagittarius,20210927,"Even if you're stuck cleaning up or doing paperwork, you should still find yourself humming a jaunty tune or at least smiling -- your good energy just can't be contained by real life."
sagittarius,20210928,"Your interpersonal relationships are improving your outlook immeasurably -- so build on them! You should find it much easier to connect with folks, even those with whom you lost touch ages ago."
sagittarius,20210929,You're not sure quite what's going on -- but that's okay! Your energy is perfect for slogging through mysteries and trusting in fate to guide you in the right direction. Go with the flow!
sagittarius,20210930,"You find that an unexpected bonus has come your way -- probably late in the day. It could be financial or it could be something less tangible, but either way, you're sure to get excited."
sagittarius,20211001,"Generosity is one of your many virtues, and today brings it out in spades. It's a great time to shower friends with gifts or just to show them how sweet life can be if you adopt the correct attitude."
sagittarius,20211002,"Your sweet, peaceful energy is exactly what's needed at work or at school today -- you can keep the peace like nobody else. Anyone who keeps fighting with you nearby is heading for disaster."
sagittarius,20211003,It's not a good time for you to promote yourself -- give it a few days before asking anyone for something new. If anything you may want to bolster the group and push for the common good.
sagittarius,20211004,"It's much harder for you to exercise authority -- in fact, you may have a mini-revolt on your hands! Try not to worry too much about the long-term, as you need to just listen and get things done today."

sagittarius,20211006,Today is all about preparations -- you've got to take some time out in order to ensure that you're ready for what's coming next. The good news is that you can make flawless plans.
sagittarius,20211007,"You've got friends who love you more than you can understand -- but you don't have to! Now is the time to call on them to help out, as they are looking for an excuse to show how much they care."
sagittarius,20211008,Your dream life and waking life seem to be merging -- but that's not a sign of madness! It's just your subconscious asserting itself in a way that should be really interesting for the next few days.
sagittarius,20211009,"A wild dream holds a strange message for you -- so try to retain the details upon waking. If they slip past you, watch for vague memories or deja vu experiences; they can set you straight."
sagittarius,20211010,Your amazing energy is bursting up and through you in something like a fountain of self-confidence. Work this out in any way that feels appropriate -- you can do almost anything now!
sagittarius,20211011,A good friend is in need -- but has decided not to ask for help. Poke around and see what you can dig up; you may be able to set them right without making them feel as if they owe you anything.
sagittarius,20211012,"Today's energy brings a kind of timidity, at least as far as change is concerned. You'd rather wait and see what happens, which is rather unusual for you. Embrace this phase and have a quiet day."
sagittarius,20211013,"You can see things a little differently today -- and you may actually find that you can express yourself more clearly as a result. Others may not fully understand at first, but they will come around."
sagittarius,20211014,It's a great day to keep your mind wide-open -- as long as you're not just going along with any kooky idea that comes your way. Retain a vestige of skepticism to keep from looking ridiculous.
sagittarius,20211015,"Your energy is directed outward and you should find it easier to deal with people on their level. In fact, communication of all kinds is enhanced, so polish up your resume or write a steamy mash note."
sagittarius,20211016,"A message comes to you today -- not in a dream, not from a pigeon, but from a minor drama playing out in the background of your life. Pay attention and then you will know what to do next."
sagittarius,20211017,"There is not enough coffee, tea or chocolate in the world to get you going this morning -- but that's okay! Sometimes you need some downtime so your brain can reorganize itself a little in the background."
sagittarius,20211018,"A child plays a role in your day. For parents, that's a no-brainer, but for others, it may take a really unexpected turn -- maybe you're called on to sit for a neighbor's kid, for example. It should be fun!"
sagittarius,20211019,"Your powerful energy is helping you to make great strides today -- so make sure that you're really pushing yourself! The more you do, the further you go, and your ambitions can come true."
sagittarius,20211020,"You may not be perfectly eager to deal with people today -- but with this kind of energy you are far better off helping out. In fact, you can rack up so much karma in one day that the rest of the year is a breeze!"
sagittarius,20211021,"Communication is easier than ever now -- as long as it's straightforward. If you're trying to be tricky or indirect, you're not going to succeed. Speak from the heart and all goes well."
sagittarius,20211022,Small details are quite important today -- so make sure that you're digging deeply and getting to the bottom of whatever you face. Things could start to improve dramatically tonight.
sagittarius,20211023,You can't quite believe that things are as hectic as they are -- but at least one of your people is talking the talk more than walking the walk. Let them know what's expected of them.
sagittarius,20211024,"It's one of those days when you really want to get to the heart of the issue -- but you never seem to quite make it. That doesn't mean the day is a waste, because all this thought is sure to yield good ideas."
sagittarius,20211025,"A good friend or close coworker feels distant today -- but it's just your energies that are out of sync. You should be back in phase quite soon, but you have to ride out this short rough patch."
sagittarius,20211026,"Your energy is a little different from usual, and it may make it hard to interact with one family member who's usually on your wavelength. Try not to read too much into the situation."
sagittarius,20211027,"Growth and expansion are in the cards today -- so get out there and drum up business or find new ways to get more out of what you've got. Your energy just can't be stopped, so go for it!"
sagittarius,20211028,"It's easier to be happy on a day like today. Somehow, your energy just clicks, so no matter what you're going through, you can see the silver lining or make the most of it in some other way."
sagittarius,20211029,"Take a risk -- though make sure you're not staking anything you can't afford to lose! There are no sure things in this life, but the odds are definitely in your favor today. Besides, it's fun to play!"
sagittarius,20211030,"People are too hard to get along with today, so make sure that you've got easy escape routes. At worst, you may need to make small talk with boring coworkers. Things get better soon."
sagittarius,20211031,"People may drive you absolutely nuts today -- so make sure that you're giving yourself the space to escape when you need it. Things may start to get a little weird later in the day, if that's possible."
sagittarius,20211101,"You're in step with the big picture today, so much so that you may neglect the little details. That's okay, because you're better off thinking long term in any case. Get excited!"
sagittarius,20211102,"It's a fun day for you and your people, so make sure that you're sharing as much as you can with as many people as possible. Your responsibilities can wait for one more day."
sagittarius,20211103,"A big laugh comes your way fairly early, so you should be able to cope with any bad news that comes up. If none does, you ought to be able to help a friend or colleague with their business."
sagittarius,20211104,"You're stuck in your head for much of today, but that's no big deal. In fact, you really need to make sure that you're exploring inner space. You can learn quite a bit about yourself and your needs if you push yourself."
sagittarius,20211105,"Socializing just doesn't work for you as well today. Make sure that you're meeting your obligations, but you almost certainly need to spend some time on your own to figure out the next step."
sagittarius,20211106,You're extra happy right now even if circumstances aren't exactly favoring you. Just try to make sure that you're sharing this good mood with others who could use the lift!
sagittarius,20211107,You can influence people more easily thanks in part to your great energy and in part to your genuine goodwill. It's time (maybe past time) for you to check in with that former enemy.
sagittarius,20211108,"You're more focused on money than usual today, but don't let that hold you back. You ought to be able to make spiritual progress too, if that's something you value. You can have it all!"
sagittarius,20211109,"The material realm holds great appeal today, but that doesn't make you greedy! If anything, you may be appreciating great art or some other physical aspect of the world that draws you in."
sagittarius,20211110,You make a great impression today on anyone from potential love interests to potential employers. You don't have to do much to get this benefit; just make sure that the right people see you.
sagittarius,20211111,"A creative notion pops into your brain and won't go away. See if you can get others to adopt it. Your social energy is great, and you may start a new trend that boosts your credibility."
sagittarius,20211112,"You're about to lose something kind of important, so keep a watchful eye out, or at least make sure that you can backtrack easily. It's just one of those days of one step forward, two steps back."
sagittarius,20211113,"Now is the time to try that new activity or go for that new career move. Though you may feel somewhat lost, that just means you're better off making a change. Go for it soon!"
sagittarius,20211114,"Your creative energy is fully engaged today, so make art, confuse strangers, or just find new ways to enjoy your everyday life. It's almost impossible to bring you down on a day like today."
sagittarius,20211115,"Things just seem to be more fun today, and your great energy is helping you to deal with people who are down on fun. In fact, you could change a few minds if you decide it's worth your while!"
sagittarius,20211116,"The big picture is wearing you down, so take a second look at the small stuff. Your energy is better spent cleaning up spreadsheets and making sure that your bills all add up anyway."
sagittarius,20211117,"This isn't the time for lofty goals or for big, crazy dreams. You need to make sure that you're realistic and, if anything, mundane. There's nothing wrong with just cleaning the kitchen, you know!"
sagittarius,20211118,"A new responsibility comes your way. Are you ready for it? You might have to deal with a little backlash, but you're sure to take to it with relish once the adjustment period is over."
sagittarius,20211119,"It's a good idea to keep extra busy today or you could find that you're just falling further and further behind. That may sound counterintuitive, but boredom is your worst enemy now."
sagittarius,20211120,"You've got plenty going on today, so make sure that you're keeping up with it all! You may find that it's way too easy to get left behind if you don't step up and get a lock on your schedule."
sagittarius,20211121,"You've got to be true to yourself even if it feels hopeless. As long as you're being honest, at least one key player should admire your grit and give you what you need. Things get better soon!"
sagittarius,20211122,"You need new depth in a romantic relationship, in a career goal, or maybe just in a hobby you want to take more seriously. Push yourself to the limit and see what you find there."
sagittarius,20211123,"A key relationship is making life a lot more interesting today, so see if you can spend extra time with that person. You may discover a new synergy you never suspected. It's time for a change!"
sagittarius,20211124,"A gamble pays off, though maybe not in the way you were hoping it would. It's important that you maintain an even keel. Even what appears to be an outright loss can be played into a win."
sagittarius,20211125,"Creative juices are flowing today. That could mean it's time to make a cake or that it's time to launch an entirely new career as an artist. It's up to you, but this energy must be put to use."
sagittarius,20211126,"Try to avoid asking for special favors or privileges today even if you're dying to. Your energy isn't favored right now, so it's more a time of regrouping and getting ready for the surge to come."
sagittarius,20211127,Things are tough. You need to deal with an authority figure who might be making demands you can't quite keep up with. Try to just smile and nod and make sure that you're not picking fights.
sagittarius,20211128,"You've got to slow down. Rushing is sure to cause more problems than it solves. If you can maintain a slow, deliberate pace, you're sure to make decent progress. Otherwise, you've got to backtrack."
sagittarius,20211129,"Your friends are worth even more to you today, and your terrific social energy keeps them firmly in your orbit. Ask for favors or just hang out. Either way, you're at your best."
sagittarius,20211130,"A group activity holds plenty of new interest, so dive in feet first and enjoy yourself! It may lead to something new socially, so look around and see who your next best friend is going to be."
sagittarius,20211201,"A vivid dream feels entirely real, but it could fade almost beyond memory once you wake up. It's not a prophecy so much as a bit of advice from your subconscious, so let it lie fallow."
sagittarius,20211202,"This might not be the best day for a date or job interview. You're just focused inward. That can work out well for all sorts of activities, but it could be difficult to show off or make a good impression."
sagittarius,20211203,Your mind is perfectly suited to introspection and meditation today. It's a good time to ask big questions of yourself. You should have a better idea of where you want to go next by nightfall.
sagittarius,20211204,"A new friend could come your way today, though it might take you two a while to warm up to each other! Just play it cool and let your great energy do all the work."
sagittarius,20211205,"A not-so-secret admirer turns their attention toward a part of your life you don't think about very often. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but you soon figure out that they're right."
sagittarius,20211206,"You've got your own unique way of thinking, and that means you can more easily shake others out of their foggy state of mind. Things may seem a little weird at first, but you can light the way!"
sagittarius,20211207,"Your sharp, direct way of speaking helps you cut through the minor-league problems others seem to be having socially. Just say what you really think and that should be all you need."
sagittarius,20211208,"Communication is all-important today, so make sure that you're speaking clearly with the people you're closest with. It's easier than ever for you to convince others you're right."
sagittarius,20211209,"A stranger asks you a question or needs your help. In any case, your open social energy is extremely helpful, and you might actually make a new friend out of it. Be open to anything!"
sagittarius,20211210,It's one of those days that starts slowly and never really seems to speed up. Try to avoid tripping over your own feet as you make it from one event to another. Things should pick up soon!
sagittarius,20211211,It's hard to get any projects moving today. Momentum is a precious commodity! That just means you need to slow down and review old successes. That's the best way to sit out your doldrums.
sagittarius,20211212,"Your energy is incredibly potent and active today, so much so that you may almost get on your family's nerves. Just let them stay in the background, because you can handle anything that comes your way."
sagittarius,20211213,You are getting so much done today that you may start to wonder where all the energy is coming from. Don't sweat it. You're also having so much fun that questions may just ruin it.
sagittarius,20211214,"You get a bit of good news that keeps your smile alive for most of the day, and you may find that it's easier than usual to communicate with difficult people. Use this to your advantage if you can!"
sagittarius,20211215,"It's the little stuff that matters most today, so make sure that you're really looking at all the details. It might seem boring at first, but it should get more and more interesting as the day progresses."
sagittarius,20211216,"You feel philosophical today, so spend extra time pondering the big issues in your life. Don't worry if you don't make it too far. Sometimes making the effort is more important than reaching a destination."
sagittarius,20211217,"If things seem dire, just remember that the outcome is up to you. It could be that you've got the time you need to take care of everything. If not, prioritize and get the right stuff done first."
sagittarius,20211218,"You feel a bit out of sync with someone close today, maybe a colleague, maybe your partner. It's hard to open up, but it's vital that you say something. This doesn't have to go on this way!"
sagittarius,20211219,"You're feeling somewhat out of sorts, especially when you're dealing with social situations. This isn't a long-term problem, though, so don't worry too much about where it all ends."
sagittarius,20211220,"You may not feel quite up to it, but it's still important that you stay as flexible as you can today. Things are sure to get weirder before they settle down, but you can adjust if you take your time."
sagittarius,20211221,"A travel opportunity comes your way, so jump on it! You're likely at least a little surprised by it, but your great energy helps you make the most of it. Could it lead to romance?"
sagittarius,20211222,"An upgrade is coming your way, or maybe you've finally decided to take that relationship to a deeper level. Something in your life is definitely heading for a big boost today!"
sagittarius,20211223,"It's time for you to deal with that authority figure who has been driving you nuts. You may not know exactly what to do, but you can for sure make a difference."
sagittarius,20211224,"This is a good time for careful planning and treading lightly. You can't just bowl over the opposition! You may find it hard to sit still, but you do know deep down that it's for the best."
sagittarius,20211225,You need to take care of all the little details even if they seem totally stupid. It's a good time for you to step up and ask for assistance when it's needed. It makes you look humble!
sagittarius,20211226,"A colleague or customer changes the way you see your work or maybe some other, more personal aspect of your life. It's a great time for reflection and for making big changes."
sagittarius,20211227,"The big picture is all-important today, so make sure that you're rising above the tiny details. You can come back to them later, or better still, get someone else to do it for you!"
sagittarius,20211228,"You're starting to get a better sense of your inner needs, and you may stumble upon something wonderful that drives you in an entirely new direction. Keep it up and see where it leads!"
sagittarius,20211229,"Your social energy seems to have deserted you, but it's just been displaced by something subtler. It's a good time to wander off on your own and think about the big issues in your life."
sagittarius,20211230,"Your mind is plunging more deeply into subjects that you may not know anything about yet. Trust in your subconscious mind to lead you toward the most interesting tidbits, because things are hard to see otherwise."

sagittarius,20220101,"A new friend may be coming your way, so don't be too surprised when you just click with someone you'd never think you would. Your great energy is like a beacon to like-minded souls."
capricorn,20210101,"You are sailing on euphoric seas of good feeling. Because of your nature, your very aura of tender feeling has a chance to inspire others by example too. "
capricorn,20210102,"Your life seems to be an uphill climb today, but that could just mean you've taken on the right level of challenge. If it gets too tiring, take a break or call in the cavalry. You can make this work!"

capricorn,20210105,"You need to step up to authority, but only as far as circumstances permit. You should find that things are somewhat more difficult than you had hoped, but your no-nonsense approach works wonders."
capricorn,20210106,"You shouldn't ask for special favors today. Things are still pretty tricky, and you need to make sure that you're not rocking the boat. You should find a middle path."

capricorn,20210115,"Today is all about incremental changes. Look around for tweaks you can make to your routines that can yield moderate improvements. It's not a time for radical rethinking, though!"

capricorn,20210225,"Your people could be extra sneaky today, and at least one of them is making claims they almost certainly can't back up. You don't have to ferret out every falsehood, but you do need to be skeptical."
capricorn,20210226,"You dig up the one missing clue that's been keeping you from breaking this case wide open. It could be romance or work related, but it should all start to fit together very soon."

capricorn,20210601,Your creative writing skills are tested today. That could mean you need to express yourself in haiku or stretch the truth a bit in order to spare someone's feelings. Make it work!
capricorn,20210602,"Think outside the box and win! If you surprise the competition, you can be sure that you are going to come out ahead. All you really need is one creative idea, but keep the flow going if you can."

capricorn,20211219,"You need to take care of business today, so make sure that you're pushing yourself to tackle everything on that to-do list. If you only make it halfway through, that just gives you something to do tomorrow."
capricorn,20211220,"A new idea comes your way that could be the answer to old questions. Don't act on it immediately. Instead, let it seep into your consciousness until you can tell what's important about it."
capricorn,20211221,"This is not the best day for making changes, but you may have to do so anyway. You're always up for a challenge, but sometimes it just feels as if it should be somebody else's problem."

aquarius,20210102,"You have discovered something new and fascinating today, so much so that you may find that things are completely turned around by the time you've readjusted to your new reality."
aquarius,20210103,"You're considerably more grounded emotionally today, which is both good and bad. You may not have as many great ideas, but you're better at dealing with that one nutty friend."
aquarius,20210104,"Business associates are mostly thinking about themselves today, so watch out! That doesn't mean you'll get stabbed in the back, just that you have to be unusually self-interested now."

aquarius,20210211,"You love positive change, and you can see the positive in almost anything today. It's a good time to check with your colleagues or family to make sure they're not nervous about what you're offering."
aquarius,20210212,Check every price tag carefully and watch out for hidden fees. It's way too easy for you to spend too much if you're not paying attention. Things should even out in a few days.
aquarius,20210213,"Your bank statement might not tell you the whole picture, so try to spend as conservatively as you can. It's just way too easy for you to blow past your limits, and nobody wants that!"

aquarius,20210307,"You aren't quite sure why things are going the way they're going today, but why should you be? You're not omniscient, and sometimes all you need to know is your name, rank, and serial number."
aquarius,20210308,"This is not the time to fight back unless you've reached the end of your rope. In all other circumstances, it's best for you to just go along with the program for now. Things are sure to change soon."

aquarius,20210310,"People are easier to sway today, so make sure you're talking! At least one recalcitrant colleague is likely to come around to your way of thinking."
aquarius,20210311,"Something's not quite right today, so rethink how you feel about it. If you adjust your attitude, you can make it better without having to exert any force on the outside world at all!"
aquarius,20210312,"You need a bit more karma, so dip into your well of compassion and see what you can find. Things are really good, but you might not see it until later on."
aquarius,20210313,"You can just barely make out a pattern that is hidden from the rest of the world. Can you use it to your advantage? If not, take some small pleasure in your instinctive intelligence."
aquarius,20210314,"You make a discovery that should keep you amused and entertained long into the night, and maybe for weeks, months, or years to come. Your brainpower is even more fierce than usual."
aquarius,20210315,"You keep humming along throughout the day. It's like you're drawing on an external power source! Things look good from where you are, and they just keep getting better!"
aquarius,20210316,"A big change could start this morning, and it's one that might cause some serious issues if you don't guide it. Your energy feels somewhat dissipated, but you can still make this a win!"
aquarius,20210317,"You stumble upon a fresh discovery that might throw you for a loop, but don't take too long to recover! Your energy is best spent on figuring out how to take this information to the right people."

aquarius,20210322,"Domestic issues are more important than ever, so make sure that you're facing that stuff with a clear mind. The leaky roof comes first, while organizing old photos has to wait."
aquarius,20210323,"You're going through some quick changes today, and that's fine by you! In fact, you might need to guide a friend or family member through the process so they can get through it without stress."
aquarius,20210324,"You spot a hidden contradiction in a friend's story today, but do you keep it to yourself? You may find it easier to let them know privately so they can confess what's what."
aquarius,20210325,"You stumble onto something big, but it might be too big for you to take it all in at once. Try your best to focus on the aspects of this situation that fit with preexisting plans."
aquarius,20210326,"You feel better about an emotional situation, and while you many not be at your peak, you are certainly grounded enough to move forward. A friend or colleague is happy with what they see."
aquarius,20210327,"Work is harder to deal with than usual, largely because others are solely looking out for themselves. You may have to do the same thing, which doesn't come naturally. This phase doesn't last long."
aquarius,20210328,"Your big brain is churning out great ideas today, so push it to new heights. Those around you are sure to be amazed as long as you're willing to share the results of your brainstorms."
aquarius,20210329,"A random social connection proves to be worth far more than you could have dreamed, so follow up on it and make sure that you're dealing with all the ramifications that arise from it."
aquarius,20210330,"You need to feel useful to society, though, of course, it has to be in your own distinctive way. Find an organization that suits you perfectly, or launch your own if nobody is doing it right!"
aquarius,20210331,"You can't quite get moving today, but that's okay! You may find that your energy is better spent on resting and recharging your batteries. Things are looking good, but you have to lie low for a bit."

aquarius,20210403,"You're feeling much more tired than you have any right to feel, so you might just try to stay in bed all day. If you've got any energy at all, you should try to use it on personal stuff."
aquarius,20210404,"You're feeling worried about new rules or restrictions, but they probably can't hold you back for long. Think clearly about what needs to happen and then just keep moving forward."
aquarius,20210405,"Your amazing energy is almost too good to be true, yet there it is all the same. Make the most of it and have fun with whatever comes your way today. Things should be really moving fast!"
aquarius,20210406,"You should be able to get some positive change in motion today. How exciting! Your energy is terrific, and others are more receptive than ever to your big ideas. Make the most of this time."
aquarius,20210407,"You could find it somewhat more difficult to distinguish between real life and daydreams, but maybe those boundaries shouldn't be so firm anyway. Think sideways as much as you can."
aquarius,20210408,"Don't expect to be able to stick rigidly to a schedule today. Things are pretty crazy, and at least half the interruptions could actually be pretty important. You can get back on track pretty soon!"
aquarius,20210409,"Money is weird today, and you might accidentally overspend if you're not careful. Try to make sure that you're not just adding to your debt."

aquarius,20210411,"You like to do things your way, and you've got a knack for getting others to let you! Things are pretty weird right now, but that's just how you like it. Enjoy, and encourage others to do the same."
aquarius,20210412,"You're still learning new tricks no matter how old your brain is. Now is a good time to focus on one thing at a time, which could be a bit boring for you. It's just that the day is all about a steady pace."
aquarius,20210413,"You're in a good position to learn from your history, so think back through the years. You might hit on one or two key lessons, or you might decide that you're a product of all your past actions."
aquarius,20210414,"Your individual perspective on life is informing your activities today and maybe causing a ruckus at work or school! It's the good kind of ruckus, though, so have fun with it."
aquarius,20210415,"Your ability to communicate is never in question, and today you prove just how powerful your voice can be. You may find that someone needs a creative jolt to get them back on track."

aquarius,20210417,"Things seem bad, but you can certainly deal with them if you can just find the time and space to focus your mental energy. Ask your friends to leave you alone for a bit so you don't lash out."
aquarius,20210418,"It's easy for you to overreact today. Things may not go your way exactly, but that doesn't mean it's the end of everything. Just take a deep breath and prepare for what's coming."
aquarius,20210419,"It's hard to concentrate with all these interruptions. You may as well start interrupting others to see what trouble you can stir up! Don't start any fights, but do derail a few (metaphorical) trains!"
aquarius,20210420,"You're in the middle of a tough situation, though you can't figure out what's what or how to fix it. There's one easy answer: compromise. Give a little and you should get a lot of what you want."
aquarius,20210421,"You're locked in a struggle with someone who doesn't seem likely to back down. Try not to worry too much about the long-term solution. Instead, focus on the here and now."
aquarius,20210422,"Details are all-important today, so make sure you're really paying attention. You are right to be skeptical of crazy-sounding offers or golden opportunities, but don't just dismiss them out of hand."
aquarius,20210423,"You need to be wary of someone who's trying to get you to do something, though there's no guarantee that they're conning you! Just try to see things more clearly and all should go well."
aquarius,20210424,"It's time for you to really connect with someone new. Your energy is fantastic, and you should be able to make a new friend or get a date with someone you never thought would be interested."
aquarius,20210425,"It's a great day to dip into different cultural styles, so get out there and dig up something really cool! Your energy is powerful, and you can discover all sorts of wonderful new activities."
aquarius,20210426,"You stumble into something new and kind of wonderful, perhaps fairly early in the day. You may find that people are more willing to let you have your way if you ask nicely."
aquarius,20210427,You're feeling a little weird about a recent promotion or renewed desire for a career move. It's time for you to deal with that directly or it's sure to hold you back otherwise.
aquarius,20210428,"Now is a good time for you to look into getting an interview at that company you want to work for or get someone important to listen to you. It might be awkward, but it should pay off!"
aquarius,20210429,"Your friends are backing you all the way today, so fall back on them if need be. You should be able to get something good out of even the weirdest situation as long as you're not alone."
aquarius,20210430,"It's a good time for you to get organized and help others do the same. You could be clearing out the clutter or trying to build something new, but it's sure to work out well."
aquarius,20210501,"Events are moving more quickly than you can grasp, but that's okay! Just deal with things as they arise and wait for the big picture to make sense on its own. You can do this!"

aquarius,20210503,"Your giant brain is full of great ideas today, so keep up the patter! You should be able to impress almost everyone you meet in one way or another. Go for it!"
aquarius,20210504,"Are you looking for love? It might find you today without your needing to do much of anything. Of course, if you do take a proactive stance, it could come that much faster! Either way, it's a win."
aquarius,20210505,"Try to take a second look at the way you view the world. You never know what could use tweaking. Even your deepest values may need to be reevaluated, so be as thorough as you can be!"
aquarius,20210506,"You need to make a choice today, probably fairly early. It comes down to compassion versus self-determination, so it's tough, but you might want to focus on the big picture instead of the little details."
aquarius,20210507,"Your big ideas are all lined up and ready to go, though the rest of the world may not be ready for them! That's no big deal, because they're sure to adapt when they see how awesome they are."
aquarius,20210508,"An altruistic act is perfect for your karma and helps balance out someone else's too! Keep it a secret if you like, but nobody will hold it against you if you share the news with the right people."
aquarius,20210509,"Your elders are more important than ever today, so try to reach out to them (or reach within yourself, if they're no longer with you). That kind of wisdom is impossible to achieve by other means."
aquarius,20210510,"Your past determines your future to a degree, but you know you're capable of surprising leaps. Still, today brings you face-to-face with an issue from your past that demands attention."
aquarius,20210511,"This is not the most exciting day of the year, but you can still find a few ways to keep your mind engaged. You might want to read old books, check in with family, or learn a new trick."
aquarius,20210512,"You need to heat things up with your partner or date, and it's easier than you think! Your amazing energy lights you up like a fireworks, and you can make anyone see what you're all about."
aquarius,20210513,"Are you looking for love? If so, expand your search now. The least likely people can spark all sorts of emotions. Look for those with at least one solid connection, but don't overthink it."
aquarius,20210514,"You may find a little health problem is starting to take over too much of your mental space, so see a professional or do something else to take care of it! You're sure to feel better afterward."
aquarius,20210515,"Get some extra exercise today or you could be even more tired than you would be otherwise! That may sound like a contradiction, but you're used to dealing with those."
aquarius,20210516,"Animals have more appeal today. Their way of living in the moment is a great lesson for you now. If you've got pets, play with them. If not, find a way to interact with someone else's."
aquarius,20210517,"You should find that life gets a little richer and more interesting today, so embrace it even if it feels strange! Your energy is great for doubling down on successes and achievements."
aquarius,20210518,"You're not always impulsive, but when you are the whole world takes notice! Push yourself in a bold, new direction today and see what others make of it. Make sure that you have fun too!"
aquarius,20210519,"You have to be more skeptical today or things could easily go sideways. Try to make sure that you're asking the right people the right questions, and don't give up until you get the right answers."
aquarius,20210520,"You're feeling more down to earth today, which might come as a relief. It's a good time for you to check in with friends or family members who may need you to discuss something delicate."
aquarius,20210521,"Business is harder than usual for you, so it might be a good time to slack off or even skip work (or your job search). Tap into your creative side and you should be back in business really soon!"
aquarius,20210522,"You need to use some of this great energy to boost your social life, and it's easy! All you have to do is turn up your activity a notch. Be your charming self and you're sure to win big!"
aquarius,20210523,"Your big brain is always a potent force of nature, and today it's firing off great ideas at a rapid clip! You can also dive deep into an issue that has been bothering you quite a bit lately."
aquarius,20210524,"You're feeling somewhat disconnected from society, and that doesn't sit right with you. Make sure that you're doing something useful and getting others to do the same if possible."
aquarius,20210525,"It might be time for a career move. Your need for change hasn't been satisfied in a while, most likely, and you may be hungry for something wildly different. Take a second look at an old plan."
aquarius,20210526,"You are feeling the social vibe today, and you ought to be able to get your people to go along with you. It's a good time for you to celebrate something small but wonderful."
aquarius,20210527,"You're the Welcome Wagon today at work, in the neighborhood, or among your friends. Make it easy for new folks to integrate into the group and you should score some much-needed karma."
aquarius,20210528,"Don't stick your neck out today. The powers that be are looking for someone to make an example of. If you can just close your door and work on your own projects, that would be perfect."
aquarius,20210529,"You feel more exhausted than you should, but it's not a sign of illness or anything else. You're just at a low-point of personal energy, but the good news is that the upswing starts tomorrow."
aquarius,20210530,"Your energy level is high, and you're launching all sorts of great new plans and programs today. It's a great time for you to show off your leadership and move forward with ease."
aquarius,20210531,"You embrace change before most people are even aware that things are different, and today is no exception. Well, it may be a little different in that you're the one implementing all this change."
aquarius,20210601,"You need to keep a tight watch over your money today, or you may find that you end up way deeper in debt than you can afford! It's too easy to make impulse buys you'll regret later."
aquarius,20210602,"Don't trust your sense of what's going on with your bank account. It's one of those days when assumptions can cost you quite a bit, so check and double-check before committing to purchases."
aquarius,20210603,"Your forward-looking ideas are incredibly influential today,  but only if you're making them known! Communication is vital for the time being, so ensure that you're talking to all the right people."
aquarius,20210604,Your altruistic side is making itself heard loud and clear today. You are definitely focused on the greater good! That may cause problems with someone close who feels too caught up in their own drama.
aquarius,20210605,"You feel a kinship with someone older despite any lack of blood ties. Follow up on this, because you could find that your future depends in some way on this new connection. It's a win!"
aquarius,20210606,"You prefer to face the future, but for now you need to make sure that your focus is on your past. That's not to say you should dwell there, but it's a good idea to learn your lessons."
aquarius,20210607,"You're a little bored today, but that boredom is like fertilizer for your creativity! It may not bloom today, but soon you should be filled with great new ideas. Until then, grab a book."
aquarius,20210608,"You start something up with a friend or colleague that could turn into a deeper relationship. On the other hand, they may read more into it than you do, so be wary of what comes next."
aquarius,20210609,"You've got to take care of a relationship that seems to be heading in a surprising new direction. This may or may not have anything to do with romance, but your great energy can help it become what you want."
aquarius,20210610,"Your emotional side is a little shaky now, but that doesn't mean that you're in peril or facing a breakdown. If anything, it could be a great time to reconnect with your partner or your family."
aquarius,20210611,"It's not easy to get started today. Your energy just seems drained from the moment you get up. That can be an asset, though, as you may find it easier to sort through your various plans."
aquarius,20210612,"Stick to your routines today. This isn't a good time for improvisation. Your energy is not up to the challenge of making quick changes, but it should be back where you want it to be soon."
aquarius,20210613,You need to reach out to the person you're negotiating with and offer a compromise. You're smart enough to see the value in going first. Someone has to do it. 
aquarius,20210614,"Someone you work with is being quite difficult, but that's not the end of the world. In fact, you may come out ahead since you've got the perfect justification for leaving them on their own."
aquarius,20210615,"Work or a job search is rough today. You may feel disconnected from your career path, but that should offer you more freedom than worry. Let yourself flow in a new direction!"
aquarius,20210616,"Little details may drive you crazy most days, but for now they capture your interest and maybe your imagination! You could dream up a new art piece or an easy answer to a tough problem."
aquarius,20210617,"Social interactions are somewhat more difficult today, so make sure that you're paying attention when dealing with others. You may just pick up on subtle signals, or they could make a huge gaffe."
aquarius,20210618,"All this brainy energy needs an outlet, so hunt down problems that need solving! You can do a lot of good today, both for yourself and others. One thing may lead to another in a chain of good karma."
aquarius,20210619,"You have to connect with someone new today, so make sure that you're looking for opportunities to reach out. Try checking in with a work contact or look for new friends on social media."
aquarius,20210620,"Your career moves are making you happy today, so make sure that you're pushing ahead at full speed! Take classes, network with the right people, and polish up that resume. It's time to move."
aquarius,20210621,"Your emotions run deep today, so check in with yourself and make sure you're being honest. It could be time for a major change, but only if it feels absolutely right."
aquarius,20210622,"You're slowing down a bit, enough that you may find it easier to sit back and let the day go by at its own pace. If you can get away with that, so much the better, but sometimes you've got to move."
aquarius,20210623,"Something shifts late in the day and you see new opportunities opening up all around you. Of course, you can't move in all directions at once, so make up your mind and get on with it!"
aquarius,20210624,"You've got friends who can do almost anything, so don't be afraid to tap into your network! It's a really good day for polishing up your resume or online profile and asking for recommendations."
aquarius,20210625,"It's easier than you think to break the rules today, but it's even easier to get caught! See if you can deal with your people in a way that keeps everyone on the same page. Restrictions are important now."
aquarius,20210626,"Make sure you can enforce a bit of discipline on yourself today. Otherwise, things are sure to fall apart by nightfall. The good news is that you should be able to get work done without distraction."
aquarius,20210627,"Your energy level is through the roof today, so make sure that you're doing something cool with it! It's a great time to work on new stuff or enlist support for your dream project."
aquarius,20210628,"Stir up trouble today, in a good way, of course! You want change more than almost anyone around you, but it's easier than ever to convince others that your way of doing things is the right one."
aquarius,20210629,"It's time for a change of heart, and that should come easily to you! Most likely you already know what needs to evolve within you, but if not, seek out your smartest friend and ask for advice."
aquarius,20210630,"You might have to rethink your approach to someone or something early in the day. If so, try to err on the side of compassion. Your energy is perfect for taking on new volunteer jobs."
aquarius,20210701,"You are starting to sense a pattern at work, one unlike what you've seen before. It's a good time for you to watch and wait, because life is just about to get a lot more interesting!"
aquarius,20210702,"A major discovery comes your way, and it's one that you need to pay attention to! Your energy is just right for exploration, experimentation, and approaching the world from a slight distance."
aquarius,20210703,"A big change is coming -- and you couldn't be more excited! If you haven't seen the signs yet, broaden your horizons until you get a glimpse. It takes time to get to you, but it's worth the wait."
aquarius,20210704,"A big discovery is waiting for you -- but it just sits there if you don't actively seek it out. Your energy is a bit dissipated, but that's fine. All you have to do is search and you should be rewarded."
aquarius,20210705,"Something starts to heat up between you and a coworker or friend. If you're looking for romance, this is it -- but if not, then you can still get quite a lot out of this relationship."
aquarius,20210706,A shared interest grows in importance between you and a friend or loved one -- and it may draw you much more tightly together. Enjoy it and see what you can do to keep it growing!
aquarius,20210707,"Your creative flow is near-perfect today, so put it to good use. That could mean anything from baking cookies to dreaming up solutions for old problems that have bugged you for years."
aquarius,20210708,"It's time to move on -- though not necessarily from any major life entanglement. If it's time to end that toxic relationship, go for it, but otherwise, just let go of your heaviest baggage."
aquarius,20210709,"Today is all about domestic business, even if you find yourself away from home for a chunk of the day. You may have to fix an appliance or smooth things over between family members."
aquarius,20210710,"You're going through a quick change of some kind -- but it's not scary or awkward! You love this kind of excitement, though those around you may have a hard time adjusting to the new you."
aquarius,20210711,You're full of contradictions today -- so embrace them! You may come to some surprising new conclusions if you push yourself mentally. It's a good time to look for crazy new ideas and solutions.
aquarius,20210712,You could stumble onto something new and fascinating today -- so keep your eyes open! It's a good time to grab new ideas from almost anywhere and apply them to your life. Things are getting better.
aquarius,20210713,"You need to deal with something quiet and personal today -- even though you may rather focus on almost anything else. It's a really good day for meditation or therapy, if those options are open to you."
aquarius,20210714,"You need to reach out and connect with someone new today -- though that may feel awkward at first. Things are actually going well for you, so it isn't that hard to push even harder."
aquarius,20210715,"Your energy is terrific today -- but it's best directed inward. You can figure out all sorts of interesting things about yourself, and you may also find an answer to an important spiritual question."
aquarius,20210716,"Its time for genuine engagement with those around you -- drop those defenses and answer from the heart. You should also ask big questions, as now is the time to get good answers."
aquarius,20210717,"It's time for you to shut that door, walk away from social media for a few hours and just try to focus on your personal situation. It may take you farther than you had imagined possible."
aquarius,20210718,"You're feeling a bit exposed today -- so much so that you may instinctually edge toward the exit. That's not like you, but for now, it may be for the best. See if you can take a time out."
aquarius,20210719,"Your deep need to feel useful is making itself known, and you may find that someone close gives you a good idea. Your energy comes flooding back once you see how valuable you can be."
aquarius,20210720,"Today is all about people getting along well together -- better than expected, in fact. You may be an important part of the social engineering, so don't be shy about introducing people or refereeing spats."
aquarius,20210721,"You meet someone new today -- or possibly succeed in recruiting someone to your cause or team. In either case, it's a good day, so make the most of it and spend plenty of time with others."
aquarius,20210722,"You're not sure what's going on today -- and that's not the end of the world. It's just one of those days when the universe is acting in mysterious ways, and it shouldn't last forever."
aquarius,20210723,"Don't struggle against anything but tyranny today -- the normal roadblocks and whatnot that life presents just aren't worth your energy. Also, they're basically insurmountable until tomorrow!"
aquarius,20210724,"It's time to open up -- your vision isn't going to change the world by itself! Once you start talking or writing, you should find others lining up to join the cause. It's amazing what a little openness can do!"
aquarius,20210725,"Those around you are still on your wavelength, and you should find it easier than ever to get the attention you need. You may also change hearts and minds, if you're so inclined."
aquarius,20210726,"You need to share something big today -- maybe some news, maybe a bonus or maybe just the light of your goodwill. Those around you may not even realize that they're benefiting."
aquarius,20210727,"Your spiritual side is front and center today, so make sure that you're focusing at least some of your time on your inner life. That can lead almost anywhere, so be prepared for an interesting ride."
aquarius,20210728,An electric current of energy is cycling through your brain now -- and not just the usual neural chitchat. You're on the verge of a breakthrough that could change your life for the better!
aquarius,20210729,
aquarius,20210730,"An older relative is causing some interesting problems today -- but none so terrible that you can't handle them. It may just be a tricky negotiation, but that's not the sort of thing that daunts you."
aquarius,20210731,"Something or someone from your past comes back to check in with you -- and while it could just be a pleasant, forgettable encounter, you may end up in an entirely new situation."
aquarius,20210801,"You're somewhat bored today -- but that's okay! Sometimes the lack of mental stimulation can lead to new ideas or exciting new adventures, but you have to go through this phase to get there."
aquarius,20210802,"Romance is in the air -- whether or not you're partnered! You could meet someone new and hot or get a surprise from your sweetie, but you can expect a smile to creep across your face soon."
aquarius,20210803,"Your brains make you more attractive than ever, so see if you can find a way to show off what you've got to the right people. Or person -- this could be romantic just as much as professional."
aquarius,20210804,"Your emotional side is dominant today, so make sure that you're paying close attention to matters of the heart. It's a really good time for you to mend fences with family members or estranged friends."
aquarius,20210805,"Things are not easy for you today -- though that could be as painless as a little extra traffic or a catty coworker. If life gets really weird, there's no shame in a strategic retreat. It can't last long!"
aquarius,20210806,"It's essential that you find a way to reach a compromise with a friend or coworker who is more than typically adversarial. Take a step back, look at the big picture, and pick the right path."
aquarius,20210807,You need to mix it up at work or in whichever group is suffering from in-fighting. Things are looking up -- but they aren't likely to improve until this struggle has been put behind you.
aquarius,20210808,"Your thinking is usually pretty flexible, but right now, you aren't sure you're capable of changing your mind about something big and important. Try to just let it roll for the time being."
aquarius,20210809,"Work is hard today -- mostly thanks to the competition, or maybe a fickle customer. You can resolve this, but you need to be careful about new legal agreements, as they may not work for you."
aquarius,20210810,"You need to handle the details now -- of whatever situation you've been putting off for too long. Make sure that you're not procrastinating, as that is the best way to end up going through this all again tomorrow."
aquarius,20210811,Your intellect is a sparkly wonder to behold -- so make sure that you're showing off at least a little! You should be able to get your people to see that things are more fun than they realize.
aquarius,20210812,"You need to reach out socially -- otherwise, you're sure to find yourself in a rut. And you hate ruts! All you need to do is say hi to someone you'd usually just walk by. They can handle the rest!"
aquarius,20210813,"A new cultural experience forces you to see things in a new light -- and it's a good one! Try not to worry too much about where it's all headed, as exploration is the name of the game today."
aquarius,20210814,"Your job prospects are opening up in a new way -- so unless you are totally committed to staying where you are, you need to open your eyes and apply for something new and exciting!"
aquarius,20210815,"It's a good day for you to explore your emotional side, as icky and uncomfortable as that might seem. You are more in touch than ever, and you can solve an old problem if you give it a go."
aquarius,20210816,Opportunity comes your way early today -- so make time for it and see where it leads! You should be able to get someone new to see things your way if you can just show them the facts.
aquarius,20210817,"Friendship really is magic for you -- and you may find that things start to get really magical late in the day! Your people know just what you need, and at least one surprise is coming your way."
aquarius,20210818,"Your feel somewhat restricted today -- maybe a new rule has been implemented, or maybe you're just finding that your energy levels aren't what they were the other day. It gets better soon!"
aquarius,20210819,"You need an iron will to make it through the cavalcade of distractions coming your way today. If you need to get anything done, you may need to put blinders on or work from home in a quiet room."
aquarius,20210820,"Your energy levels are terrific today -- so make sure that you're making the most of them! You should find that you are better able to deal with people, even if they just don't seem to get you."
aquarius,20210821,Your thirst for positive change is making life a lot more interesting today -- so make sure you are stirring up interest in progress. It's a really good time for you to shake things up!
aquarius,20210822,"This is a bad time to spend without thinking -- your money is likely to be needed in the near future. Things aren't exactly catastrophic, but you are almost certain to need more than you've got soon."
aquarius,20210823,Don't take that ATM slip too seriously -- you may have a sizable discrepancy coming one way or the other. That means you ought to play it safe financially until it all shakes out.
aquarius,20210824,"You've overextended yourself in some way, and should find that you need to backtrack quickly in order to make things right, The good news is that it shouldn't take very much time!"
aquarius,20210825,Your ideas are getting a receptive audience today -- even though it may seem that everyone around you is heading in a different direction. That's just a trick of perspective when you're the center of their orbit.
aquarius,20210826,"You need to show that one friend or colleague that giving can be as good as receiving. You may need to lead by example, but even just a subtle nudge could be enough to make it work."
aquarius,20210827,"You are a lifelong learner, and today brings something new and interesting your way. It may be a good time for you to check in with someone you haven't heard from in too long."
aquarius,20210828,"Something you picked up a long time ago comes back in a new, fresh way -- and you can't believe that it's still relevant. Make the most of it and see if you can make a real difference."
aquarius,20210829,Creative energy makes you approach the day in a new way -- and you may find that your people are grateful for the new ideas you generate. It's a great time to lead a team or to blaze a trail.
aquarius,20210830,"You have your own way of seeing the world, and today highlights your unique perspective. Don't hold back when discussing big issues with people -- they need to hear your side."
aquarius,20210831,"Animals of all sorts are more appealing -- and deliver more wisdom -- than usual. If you've got pets, spend some time communing with them; if not, head out into the world and find one you can learn from."
aquarius,20210901,"You're a little overwhelmed, but that stems mostly from distractions and interruptions. Try to get some perspective on the big picture. Focus is all you need to handle everything that's coming."
aquarius,20210902,"Try not to push too far -- overreaction is a real possibility, and you may find that your energy is better spent on moving forward than on dwelling on the past. Enjoy what you've got."
aquarius,20210903,"Your independence is never in question -- but today, you may find that someone tries to rein you in. Show them what you think about that and try not to let them push you too far."
aquarius,20210904,It's hard to get very much done today -- but not because of anything going on within you. It's one of those days when your energy is better spent on putting out little fires than focusing on long-range plans.
aquarius,20210905,"You need to deal with a business problem that isn't going away, as much as you wish it would. Try not to worry about the consequences in the very long term, as that is completely unforeseeable now."
aquarius,20210906,"If you don't take care of the little details of this upcoming trip or project, no one else will. It's boring and maybe a little frustrating, but you've got what it takes to guarantee success in the future."
aquarius,20210907,"Take care today -- especially when other people's feelings are on the line. You may find that folks are more sensitive, or just that what you say comes out differently than what you meant."
aquarius,20210908,"You make a great new connection today -- with someone you'd usually not look twice at. It may be romantic, career-related or even something spiritual, but you need to take it seriously."
aquarius,20210909,"You need to branch out a bit -- maybe try out a totally new restaurant or cuisine, maybe plan a big trip somewhere far away or maybe even pulling up your roots and moving somewhere totally different."
aquarius,20210910,Emotional business is more intense today -- and that could mean that you're finally ready to confront that one situation that has been hanging over you for quite some time. Go for it!
aquarius,20210911,You aren't moving as quickly as you would like today -- but that doesn't mean it's time to give up! Just slow down and let the world set your pace. You may learn something really valuable.
aquarius,20210912,"A new friend or colleague shows you the way to something new and cool today -- so be open to change. That's not usually a problem for you, but this time it may come by surprise."
aquarius,20210913,"Your social connections are especially vital today -- so make sure that you're really paying them heed. In fact, you should go out of your way to reach out to those on the fringes so they remember you better."
aquarius,20210914,"This is not the time to stick your neck out -- if anything, you may want to take the day off! Your energy is just a bit out of sync with those around you, but it's enough to cause some stress if you're careless."
aquarius,20210915,"Your energy levels are ebbing -- but the tide is coming back in soon! By this time tomorrow, you may feel as if you can conquer the world. Relax and putter the day away if you can."
aquarius,20210916,"Your great energy feels almost limitless -- so get on it and make sure that you're doing what needs to be done. It's a great time to enlist others in your cause, too. Open up and share the wealth!"
aquarius,20210917,You love change -- or at least you like provoking change. Today gives you a big new opportunity to take something that isn't quite working and try to improve it quickly and simply.
aquarius,20210918,"You may feel excited over something that doesn't seem like that big a deal to others -- but so what? Your ability to see potential is heightened right now, which could lead to some bold new ideas."
aquarius,20210919,"Something you share with a friend or family member turns into a liability today -- so make sure that you're ready to negotiate. Your energy needs to be used for something different, anyway!"
aquarius,20210920,"Spirituality becomes difficult to distinguish from hard, cold reality today. You may need to ensure that you're not confusing your friends -- it's too easy to drift into the ether while chatting."
aquarius,20210921,Something new and cool blows your mind today -- so get ready for some amazing times! It's a sure bet that you're able to convince others to go along with you as you wrangle with this new idea.
aquarius,20210922,"You are pretty far out there today, and it may feel as if you're destined to be misunderstood for you entire life. Don't despair! There are others who think like you do, out there waiting for you to speak up."
aquarius,20210923,"Nothing interesting is happening today -- or at least that's how it feels. You might not even look up from your phone as a high-speed chase zips by, actually. Boredom is how you recharge."
aquarius,20210924,"Your mind is always absorbing new information, but today it almost feels like it's coming in against your will. It's not such a bad thing, but you should watch out for overload."
aquarius,20210925,Find new ways to get your message out there -- you can reach ten times as many people with not much more effort. It's a good day to rethink your plans and make a real difference with people.
aquarius,20210926,"Your love life starts to sizzle in a new way -- even if you've been with the same person for years. Your emotional energy is peaking, and you feel better than you ever have about romance."
aquarius,20210927,"Expect a connection to get deeper today -- maybe a romance blossoms, or maybe a work contact turns into a headhunter on your behalf. Kick back and enjoy the ride. Your energy helps you all the way!"
aquarius,20210928,"Your emotional side is making itself known today, but it's not all rosy. You could actually step all over your plans if you aren't careful, so try to just take things one step at a time and remember what's important."
aquarius,20210929,"Try not to let your emotions get in the way of doing what needs to be done. Your energy is best spent on things that are practical and positive, so make sure that you're keeping your spirits up!"
aquarius,20210930,"Something small gets in between you and your work today. It could be a needy kid or a stray idea that won't let go, but in any case, it's hard to pay attention to your most important business."
aquarius,20211001,A compromise brings a new success -- and possibly lays the groundwork for even bigger things to come! It's a good day for you to pay attention to your colleagues who can help you make a difference.
aquarius,20211002,"Someone close is making a move -- possibly to usurp some measure of power from you. That's not cool, so you need to stand your ground as much as you can. Don't let them distract you from bigger issues, though."
aquarius,20211003,"You feel a bit better about an emotional issue that has been lying dormant for quite a while. It may just be time to let it go, or maybe you stumble on new information that changes your perspective."
aquarius,20211004,"Business deals are trickier than they appear -- so read over everything twice or get a lawyer to look at anything before you sign. Then if it passes the gut check, you're probably good to go."
aquarius,20211005,"With social energy like this, you can't afford to hang back and pretend to be aloof. You should wade into the action and meet new people -- even if you consider yourself a lifelong introvert."
aquarius,20211006,"Your big brain is itching for new information -- so make sure that you're feeding it with a steady diet of the best news, analysis and wit you can find. You may stumble onto something entirely new."
aquarius,20211007,"You run into a friend of a friend whom you don't know well -- and may seem somewhat far removed from your usual circles. Force yourself into social contact, as this is a golden connection."

aquarius,20211010,You are making life even sweeter for one person -- regardless of romantic intent. Your social energy is perfect for strengthening your network and for building any kind of community.
aquarius,20211011,"Today is huge -- it involves many doors opening, and possibly a major life change. It's all positive even if it seems like it could be iffy, so embrace whatever it is that comes your way."
aquarius,20211012,"If you feel exhausted, it's only because you're running on fumes -- but a refueling stop is just ahead! Don't worry if you don't get too much done today, because things are sure to change soon enough."
aquarius,20211013,"A new rule at work or home is stressing you out ... but you're going to have to make your peace with it. Things may start to get pretty interesting, actually -- so pay attention!"
aquarius,20211014,"Your divine energy is radiating out in all directions, attracting all the right people to your brilliance. It's a great time for some new ideas, and your creative energy is nearly boundless!"

aquarius,20211016,"It's all too easy for you to lose your train of thought today -- so try to keep careful notes or, better still, avoid any in-depth projects. You may stumble upon new inspiration more easily."
aquarius,20211017,"It's hard to keep track of spending today -- so it may be best to cut it out entirely! Of course, some expenses are unavoidable, so focus on those to the exclusion of all else."
aquarius,20211018,"Your informal attitude is making life a whole lot more interesting for a friend or colleague. In fact, you may be able to wheedle more info out of them than you could otherwise."
aquarius,20211019,What's the big idea? You would know -- your mental energy is busting out with almost too many for you to keep up with. Things start to get really interesting by the end of the day.
aquarius,20211020,"Something strange is afoot today -- so make sure that you're able to keep up with it! Your energy feels too scattered to be of use, and those around you are unusually focused. Still, you've got a role to play."
aquarius,20211021,"A parent or older family member needs you -- but they may be too proud to reach out. Things are looking good, but that just means that you've got to scratch the surface and figure out what needs to be done."
aquarius,20211022,"Your past mistakes come back to haunt you -- but it's nowhere near as bad as you'd feared! In fact, given all you've learned, you may be able to finally put all that behind you for the last time."
aquarius,20211023,"Find a new way to say what needs to be said. Have fun with it, too -- the people around you are sure to love it when you bust out with a limerick that explains fire safety or whatever you need to convey."
aquarius,20211024,Your love life may get quite a bit more exciting today -- so spend time with that sweetie or ask out that cute new colleague. No matter what happens you should have a big smile on your face.
aquarius,20211025,"Your brain is a terrific asset -- but today, it may just get in the way of progress! Try not to overthink or make too much of small clues. Just work with the surface reality and you should be fine."

aquarius,20211027,You need to fight against hidebound ideas and folks who seem to like their cages -- freedom of thought and action are everything to you now. Your energy is gathering for a burst of creativity later on.
aquarius,20211028,A new relationship is changing the way you think about life. It doesn't have to be romantic -- even a new barista could make a real difference. Your mind is more flexible than usual.
aquarius,20211029,Your energy may be off-balance -- but it's really your relationships that are out of whack. You need to throw yourself into figuring out your friends and family before you can make progress.
aquarius,20211030,"People all seem to be wandering off in different directions today -- there's no herding them! Don't bother, because they're all focused on different plans anyway. Things should improve in a few days."
aquarius,20211031,"Try to take a second look at this situation -- you may need to go beneath the surface if you want to understand what's really going on. Your mental energy is a bit subdued, but it should reappear soon."
aquarius,20211101,You're exploring new ways to live your life. It could be as simple as a dietary change or as wide-ranging as a new spiritual outlook. Adopt ideas from other cultures and see what happens.
aquarius,20211102,"Your amazing personal energy is helping you to see the truth behind whatever is really going on these days, so make sure that you're open to almost anything. New people are key."
aquarius,20211103,"It's the perfect day to focus on personal issues, so drill down into whatever is most important to you. Things should make quite a bit more sense by this time tomorrow if you do."
aquarius,20211104,"A recent move up (at work or somewhere else) leaves you with mixed feelings. That's not to say that things are bad, just that sometimes you doubt yourself. That can be an asset, so don't stop now!"
aquarius,20211105,"You feel open to new things, and you should find that you acquire an audience once you start talking about your new interests. It's awkward at first, but starts to get really interesting later on."
aquarius,20211106,"A good friend saves the day, and you didn't even realize that it needed saving! Things are looking good even if you're not totally sure how you got here in the first place."
aquarius,20211107,"A work or social group needs your help, though it may end up being kind of boring. It's still rewarding, but you might need to deal with someone who just doesn't understand you."
aquarius,20211108,You may find yourself adrift if you don't lock down your schedule or otherwise find a way to enforce some discipline. It's just too hard for you to care about your work right now!
aquarius,20211109,"It's the subtle stuff that makes life weird today, so make sure that you're paying careful attention to what people aren't saying out loud. Once you figure it out, the rest is pretty easy."
aquarius,20211110,Your sense of mounting excitement over some new or potential opportunity is heating up the very air around you. Others are taking notice! This could be the start of something totally huge.
aquarius,20211111,"You've got an ambitious side and today it's making itself heard loud and clear! Obstacles should be clear, and you should find that things start to build toward a brighter future."
aquarius,20211112,"Your dedication to the community (or the planet) is your main inspiration today. Make sure that you're focusing your attention on any big, broad issues that you think are vitally important."
aquarius,20211113,"Though you could still have lingering doubts about a large issue, you still need to put yourself first today. See if you can get your people to take care of their own problems for a change."
aquarius,20211114,"Your big ideas might be too much for some people, but the right folks are sure to see them for the gems they are. Don't ever shut up about them, and look for opportunities to advance them today."
aquarius,20211115,"This is the perfect day to let your weirder ideas out in the open. They're more likely to find the right ears now. In fact, you could drift into a new kind of life that is much more to your liking."
aquarius,20211116,"Learning comes naturally to you, but today you could feel like you need to deal with something that seems like more of a grind. Your big brain needs this new stuff, but it takes work."
aquarius,20211117,"A relative regales people with stories of your past, but you're not so sure they happened quite the way they say they did. Join in or add a comment to correct the record, but this dispute may not get settled soon."
aquarius,20211118,"It's time for a change, but not one of your famous radical shifts. This is a good day for something small and progressive, just enough so that people take notice but not so much that they get nervous."
aquarius,20211119,"Your unique nature is making your life much more interesting, both for you and for those around you! There might be one key player who is deeply confused, so reach out and show them what's what."
aquarius,20211120,"You can find all sorts of ways to show off your ideas today, and the crazier the better! Your amazing energy helps you to reach those who might ordinarily be unmoved by your mere words."
aquarius,20211121,"A new responsibility is coming your way, like it or not. The good news is that it's sure to bring with it an increased sense of accomplishment, so enjoy it as it comes. Time should make a difference."
aquarius,20211122,"You have to overcome a little detail that's been bugging you lately. Things may conspire against you for a little while, but that's a temporary situation. Live and let live."
aquarius,20211123,"You have to get moving today, preferably away from an old habit or some emotional baggage that's been weighing you down for far too long. It's time to make that change for real."
aquarius,20211124,"Your creative side is energized, but it may not feel like a net positive. There could be any number of reasons for that, but the likely culprit is a lack of balance. Seek out people and activities that ground you."
aquarius,20211125,"Sudden changes just don't faze you like they do most people, but since you're surrounded by people, it still means you've got work to do today. Help shepherd them through the worst of it."
aquarius,20211126,"You've reached a place emotionally in which you're pretty sure that you're ready to confront that old baggage or take a positive step toward a braver life. In either case, you move with confidence."
aquarius,20211127,"Work and business are tougher arenas for you than usual, but that's not to say that you should shy away or back down from them. If anything, you just need to step up your game!"
aquarius,20211128,"The details of today's engagement are making you a little crazy, but they still need to be managed. Make sure that you're telling people what they need to hear, not just what they're willing to hear."
aquarius,20211129,"A wave of great intellectual energy flows through you today, and it may float some great ideas up to the surface. Collect them for later. This is no time for action. Deep conversations are satisfying."
aquarius,20211130,"You make an amazing social connection with someone you'd normally never meet. Chance is a powerful force right now, so keep your eyes open and make sure that you're attentive."
aquarius,20211201,"If you're even the slightest bit dissatisfied with your job, you might need to make a change soon. There's good news: you're in the right place at the right time to make the jump seamlessly."
aquarius,20211202,"Your emotional state is a bit more distressed than you're used to for now, but there's good news as well. You could find that you've got a surprising wave of strength passing over you."
aquarius,20211203,"Slow down and let things happen today. You don't want to push anyone to move faster than they're comfortable with. The consequences would just be too dire, and you don't need that kind of stress."
aquarius,20211204,"New opportunities are coming your way, so make room for them! You should find that your social energy keeps you in other people's minds in a way that works out well for everyone."
aquarius,20211205,A friend brings a message your way that feels like a warning but is actually an invitation. Keep pondering it until you get the perspective you need to figure it out correctly.
aquarius,20211206,"You are facing a new rule or restriction that seems like the end of the world, but it's really just a detour. Take a deep breath and then look around for solutions that can keep you happy."
aquarius,20211207,All you need to make it through today is a little self-discipline. Try not to worry about the problems you're facing. Just push yourself to do the right thing and all will be well.
aquarius,20211208,"Your energy level is through the roof today, so much so that you might wear out those around you with your constant motion and flow of ideas. If so, move on to the next group of friends."
aquarius,20211209,"Change is coming, and you're the one responsible! It feels good to see so much in motion, and your terrific personal energy should ensure that you're able to deal with it all at once."
aquarius,20211210,"It's tempting to go for your wallet at the first sign of trouble today, but you need to avoid the temptation to overspend. This is one of those times when your bank account may be misleading."
aquarius,20211211,"You may think you've got more money than you really do, so try hard to avoid unnecessary spending. You should be able to make it through the day without digging yourself in any deeper."
aquarius,20211212,"Your big ideas are creating all sorts of fascinating problems, but they're not the kind that cause stress! If anything, they should make it easier for you to get ahead as you solve them one by one."
aquarius,20211213,"You're not thinking of yourself as you take care of today's business. In fact, you might be totally altruistic in your dealings. If so, you score maximum karma and should have an easy time over the next few weeks."
aquarius,20211214,An older relative is in need but may not know that you're the best person to ask for help. Check in with likely candidates and see what you can do for them. It could extend beyond tech support!
aquarius,20211215,"A blast from the past may be less than it appears at first glance. You are right to be skeptical! Make sure that you're not just reacting to old feelings, though. This could get tricky."
aquarius,20211216,"You and a friend or colleague are so close you're practically married, and your great energy helps you make incredible progress today! It's a great time for you to see about making big plans."
aquarius,20211217,"Your love life could see a huge boost from an unexpected source today! Maybe a friend introduces you to someone new based on a mutual interest, or maybe you bump into an old crush."
aquarius,20211218,"An emotional wave carries you past your usual comfort zone, but don't worry! You should find that you're better able to handle the problems that arise today as long as you can yell at them."
aquarius,20211219,"Something is trickier than usual, so make sure that you're dealing with whatever it is as carefully as you can. Things may start to get a little weird once you get past this phase, though."
aquarius,20211220,"Some days are filled with excitement, and then there are days like today. Stick to your routines as much as you can. They are your surest guide through this rough patch."
aquarius,20211221,"You need to deal with an issue that requires compromise, and that may actually come pretty easily to you on a day like today. See if you can get all parties to agree to something big."
aquarius,20211222,"A power struggle is making life weird for you even though you may not be directly involved. Things are looking up, but that could also mean that people are looking for an advantage."
aquarius,20211223,"Work and business are twice as hard as they ought to be today, so make sure that you've got someone else covering for you or at least advising you. Things should start to add up in a few days at the most."
aquarius,20211224,"Now is the time you have to go over all the little details of your work, so make sure that you're paying close attention! It may be the most boring day of the month, but at least things pick up soon."
aquarius,20211225,"Social energy doesn't flow well for you today, so if you can avoid high-intensity engagements like dates or job interviews, do so. If you have to, you are at your best playing it low-key."
aquarius,20211226,"You might feel like you're on Mars today. People are hard to understand, but the effort is definitely worth it! You should make a key discovery that helps you quite a bit going forward."
aquarius,20211227,"Something new and unexpected turns up today, and you should find that it's a signpost on a road you didn't even know you were taking! You're correct to be excited, and things should get even more interesting tomorrow."
aquarius,20211228,"You'd like to be moving more quickly in your relationship or your career, but things seem to be stalled out. It's all a matter of perspective, but that may not help you feel better about it all."
aquarius,20211229,"You need to get together with someone who's almost desperate for an audience with you. And while that might start to feel tedious, you should do your best to humor them. Things get better soon!"
aquarius,20211230,"You need to get your altruism out today, so volunteer or do good deeds all over the place! The more you do, the easier it gets and the more fun you have, so make sure that your halo is on straight."
aquarius,20211231,"You are more in step with your people than ever before, and you should find that your social energy helps you really understand group dynamics. That makes it simpler to lead the way."
aquarius,20220101,"Someone new pops up in your social circles or at work, and this is a good addition! Make sure you embrace them, because a show of aloofness at this point could take months to repair."
pisces,20210101,"This is not a good time to get swept up in other people's drama. That isn't to say that you need to separate yourself from the world entirely, but you should try to rise above the petty stuff."
pisces,20210102,"Your boss, whatever that word means to you, is hard to deal with today. Try not to antagonize them, but at the same time you need to stand up for yourself to avoid being knocked over."
pisces,20210103,"Whatever you're worried about today, you need to just go for it quickly or you're sure to mire yourself in doubts and worries. There's no time for that! Act first, question later."
pisces,20210104,"This isn't a day for deep thought. You might not even be able to get a grasp on the essentials, so just do your best and try to figure it all out later. Get a friend to help piece it together."
pisces,20210105,"It's a good time to think about settling a big debt or at least starting to chip away at it in earnest. If your finances are in good shape, consider what you owe to others emotionally."
pisces,20210106,"You could drive yourself crazy if you think too hard about what the various people in your life owe you. Try not to worry too much about it. In fact, forgiveness is the best possible course of action now."
pisces,20210107,"You're finding it easier to get things done, so much so that you could close an important deal long before you thought you would. Now is a great time to sign on the dotted line."
pisces,20210108,"You're feeling a bit fuzzy-headed, but that's nothing to worry about. In fact, you get along better than most with a lack of information. Just push forward wherever your intuition takes you."
pisces,20210109,"You can count on a little stroke of luck today, maybe not enough to change your life but certainly enough to bring a smile. Push it a little if you want to show off to that one special person!"
pisces,20210110,"Work issues are bothering you now, but that could just mean that you need to deal with the situation in a bold new way. Try to get your friends or family to help you with your search, if that's what you decide."
pisces,20210111,"You need to show some leadership today, and it's easier than ever! You may find that your energy is better spent on acting than thinking, but do whatever is best for the group as a whole."
pisces,20210112,"Things need to change for your family or work group, so start the conversation. You should be able to handle whatever is coming up next, but others may need some prodding before that can happen."
pisces,20210113,"You've got to reach out to someone who can be of use to you. It's not that your situation is dire or hopeless, just that you've got people who can really help out. There's no shame in asking."
pisces,20210114,"Your brain is full! Well, that's what it feels like, anyway, as your various thoughts compete and conspire in there with seemingly little control. It's all going to add up to something great in a few days."
pisces,20210115,"Focus is hard to come by today, so you should take what you can get. When you find some downtime, try to spend it on plans and projects that mean the most to you."
pisces,20210116,"Don't just treat yourself to a snack. Go whole hog and get the best, most decadent treat you can find. Today is all about you, and you need to indulge your taste for the good life while you can."
pisces,20210117,"You've got a friend who can help today, even if you think you don't need help. You may be doing them a favor by allowing them to feel needed, and that kind of karma is the sweetest."
pisces,20210118,"Your head's in the clouds again, but it feels comfortable up there. You may not get a lot done today, but you should feel more relaxed by the end of the day. Someone may wonder why."
pisces,20210119,"Something you had counted on turns out to be not so reliable. In fact, it may feel as if you've been cheated! Try to just pull back and see the situation as a whole. It should make sense soon."
pisces,20210120,"You need to express yourself in writing today, especially if you're dealing with a crush, romantic partner, or even family member. Your energy needs grounding and writing can provide that."
pisces,20210121,"Art makes you whole, and on a day like today, you need to soak up more than usual. You feel good, but something deep within you is driving you to experience life as others see it."
pisces,20210122,"If you find yourself at a loss for words, and that's likely, then you need to abandon all pretense of rationality and resort to poetry or performance art to get your point across. It can be fun!"
pisces,20210123,"Don't let yourself get nailed down to any specific arrangements today. You need to make sure that you're as free and available as you can be. Things may get weird later on, though."
pisces,20210124,"Creative energy is flowing through the day, and you should take advantage of it. You may not be able to explain your impulses to others, so keep them to yourself until later."
pisces,20210125,"Unexpected news concerning your love life could be challenging to deal with, especially if it comes out of the blue. Is it possible you’ve been wrong about someone or something this whole time?"
pisces,20210126,"You love a good mystery, more than most, in fact. Today brings the opportunity to explore something deep and weird and kind of cool, so dive in and see where this takes you."
pisces,20210127,You have to keep a firm grip on your imagination today or you might drift so far off that it takes you all day to get back to where you started! Just try to keep focused as much as you can.
pisces,20210128,"Your rich fantasy life could make for a strange day today, if not for you, then for those around you. It's all too easy to get caught up in what you want to see rather than what's really there."
pisces,20210129,"You need to focus on your health today even if you feel fine. In fact, you might be better off handling long-term issues if you feel great, so get it together and find a way to embrace wellness."
pisces,20210130,"Your relationships are making life a little bit better, so try not to go it alone! Focus on friends and family so you can find a new, better way to make it through all your chores and tasks."
pisces,20210131,"A friend or family member could ask for help urgently, or maybe skirt the issue hoping that you notice and take pity on them. It's kind of a big deal, so keep your eyes open and then leap to the rescue."
pisces,20210201,You may run into a few problems at work or at home or anywhere else you have to work with one other person. Partners may turn into authority figures without meaning to.
pisces,20210202,It's one of those days when you've got to clear out your head to make room for new concepts. Let go of your baggage and make sure that you're facing the day with an open mind.
pisces,20210203,"You could be treated like a servant today, but you've got enough intense energy to rebuff those who don't appreciate you. Make sure they know what's what as you do things your way."
pisces,20210204,"You feel somewhat unsure of yourself, but that's not such a terrible problem. You basically feel good. As long as you're working within comfortable situations, you should do just fine."
pisces,20210205,You need to withstand the rush of fear that creeps over you as you head into something important. It's just the part of you that is afraid to fail. You're stronger than it is!
pisces,20210206,"You're feeling a little riled over an issue that didn't seem to matter at all a while ago. It's a good time to let the other side have it, but you shouldn't expect to change very many minds."
pisces,20210207,"An authority figure makes life difficult for you, but that doesn't mean you have to sit there and take it. Though it's not a good time for confrontation, you can start to attract allies to your cause."
pisces,20210208,"You've got people watching out for you, so don't worry too much about the little bumps and snags that pop up today. It's easier than usual to believe in guardian angels after you look back on the day."
pisces,20210209,"At least one colleague makes a real difference in your life, maybe helping you to get a new gig or easing today's workload. Either way, shower them with gratitude when all is said and done."
pisces,20210210,"You feel the urge to reach out and help lots of people today, so donate money, volunteer your time, or just go the extra mile when interacting with people in your daily life."
pisces,20210211,"Your sleeping life may be somewhat more interesting than your waking life today, but that just means that your ability to pick up on subtle intuition is stronger in your dreams. Write them down!"
pisces,20210212,"Try to spend time with your people today, online or in person. They energize you and you return the favor, leaving all of you feeling terrific and ready for almost anything. Make bold moves!"
pisces,20210213,"You are focusing on yourself today, or you should be! Someone close is in awe of your confidence, and you should make sure that they see the positive side of their own circumstances as well."
pisces,20210214,"You feel totally wrapped up in something that makes you feel a bit crazy, but don't let go! This is a sign that you're on the right track, and enlightenment isn't far behind. Keep going!"
pisces,20210215,"You can't help but feel somewhat ambiguous about the news you get today. There's nothing wrong with that, even if it seems that decisive action may be called for. Wishy-washy is the new black!"
pisces,20210216,"You have to speak up to be heard today, but it's well worth your while. Your ideas have the potential to make life much better for those around you, and they are more receptive to them."
pisces,20210217,"You look as good as can be now, so enjoy it! You may find that at least one head is turned when you walk by, even if you're part of a long-term couple. Get ready for some jealousy!"
pisces,20210218,"Your love life is still bubbling with great energy, so make the most of it. Spend some quality time with your partner, or if you're single, look for someone new. Work your magic!"
pisces,20210219,"You're starting to get creeped out by how much is piled on your desk, and then one more task gets added and you're overwhelmed. Get help! There's no shame in delegating responsibility."
pisces,20210220,"This is not such a good day to plan big moves or make any sudden changes. Things are okay as they are, and you should be in a better place to try new activities in a few days or weeks."
pisces,20210221,"Your inner romantic is fully engaged with the world. You just see things differently! If you're involved, make sure you spend time with your beloved, and if not, get out there and get noticed!"
pisces,20210222,You're having too much fun to recall why you should be bored or upset or sad. Your personal energy just seems to counteract all those negative emotions. Enjoy it and try to share it!
pisces,20210223,"Creative energy is filling every crevice of your being, but it needs a release! Make some art, dance in the living room, act out improve scenes at work, or do whatever comes naturally."
pisces,20210224,"You need to pull back a bit. It's too easy for you to be somewhat overbearing today, and your people respond poorly to that. Just offer enough input to make sure your voice is heard."
pisces,20210225,"You have to mind your own business today, but that should be fairly easy. With one exception, your people are mostly lying low, so you don't have too much drama to deal with."
pisces,20210226,"It's way too easy for you to go overboard with criticism today, which isn't usually your style. Even if someone asks directly for your input, just keep it as positive as possible."
pisces,20210227,"Your left brain is unusually active right now, so make the most of it. Things are looking up, and you should be able to solve an important problem that has been bugging you for some time."
pisces,20210228,"You don't have to know exactly what you're dealing with in order to score a big win today, so relax your fears and doubts and just act in the moment. Believe in yourself and it will all work out."

pisces,20210302,"Someone owes you a favor or a lot of money. This is a good time to get some value out of it however you can. That might involve a compromise, but today is perfect for getting some of what you want."
pisces,20210303,"You need to sign something big (though it may be a figurative signature). This is an auspicious time for it, but you need to make your choices carefully. All is not as it seems."
pisces,20210304,"You can't quite get a grasp on today's big news, but you don't have to! Things are looking up overall, and the specifics don't really matter. You can explain it all later if you like."
pisces,20210305,You are sure to find things falling into place for you. So make sure that you're taking advantage of this short streak of good luck. You can make a real splash!
pisces,20210306,"You run into a work-related problem that could be extremely minor or could lead you to completely change your career goals. In either case, take the issue seriously and ensure that others do the same."
pisces,20210307,"Your leadership potential isn't fully tapped yet, but today brings a new opportunity to change the group dynamic. You can get people to see that they can work together to make a real difference!"
pisces,20210308,"Track down what the group really needs, though you may find that nobody can tell you explicitly. It's a good idea to use your intuition to narrow down the field until you've got a few choices."
pisces,20210309,"You could be finding it harder to focus today. Your mental energy may be scattered, but that just means that you've got to redouble your efforts. You can do it!"
pisces,20210310,"You have to collect your thoughts today. Things are difficult, but you may still need to get organized despite everything else that's going on. Get some help, if need be, and things should go well for you."
pisces,20210311,"Your amazing personal energy doesn't do anyone any good if you don't direct some portion of it to yourself. You deserve the best, and it's a good time for you to give yourself something nice."
pisces,20210312,It's okay to spend a little extra on yourself today. You deserve it! Give yourself something sweet to tide you over. Spread the joy around too!
pisces,20210313,"You need to deal with something that feels cloudy and vague and there's no putting it off this time! Fortunately, you're at your best when dealing with ambiguities, so investigate with confidence."
pisces,20210314,"A clever forgery turns your day into a weird mystery, but it likely isn't a criminal conspiracy. You need to make sure that you get all the facts before you make any final decisions!"
pisces,20210315,"You need to shake yourself out of a delusion of some kind, but it's hard to tell what until you've cleared your head completely. That may take a few days, so get started while you've got energy!"

pisces,20210317,"Your artistic side is making a splash today, which could mean that you're at the center of attention or that a recent statement of some kind is finding new resonance with those around you."
pisces,20210318,"If you can't get through to that colleague or friend, get creative. You're more likely to get noticed if you dig into that well of poetic sentiment that seems to go down forever."
pisces,20210319,"Try not to get bogged down in details today. In fact, do your best to avoid specifics, if at all possible. Your energy isn't meant to be used for paperwork, at least on a day like today!"

pisces,20210321,"You need to spend more time asleep, or at least daydreaming, while this great spiritual energy flows through you. Expect clear messages from the subconscious and beyond throughout the day."
pisces,20210322,"You feel as if you're performing in some kind of action-adventure movie today, only without so many explosions. Your heart is pounding, and you feel like you're really living large!"
pisces,20210323,"Your co-workers are driving you insane today, or your job search, if you're currently between gigs. Something about the world of work just doesn't sit right, but this can't last forever."
pisces,20210324,"Keep well away from the drama today. You've got enough going on without getting sucked into anyone else's little world. You might even want to stay home or keep your door shut, if possible."
pisces,20210325,"Someone in power is causing some problems today, but all you can really do is placate them. It's easier than you may realize, but it could take a long time. Get to work early!"
pisces,20210326,"This isn't a time for deep thought. You need to act! Your energy is revved up, and you might need to push yourself far beyond your usual boundaries. Make it happen as soon as you can!"
pisces,20210327,"Things are more than a little mysterious today, but you can't understand them yet, so don't push yourself. All will become clear in a day, week, or month. For now, just react and adapt."
pisces,20210328,"This might be a good time for you to forgive a debt. Even if you think you can't afford it, what you gain in karma, relaxed emotional state, and spiritual value is sure to make it worth your while."
pisces,20210329,"You're faced with a stark choice, but whatever decision you make should have positive consequences. You may find that your energy is split, but you can still make a real difference."
pisces,20210330,"Try not to take on too much today, especially not with people or activities you're not certain you understand. Your energy may feel terrific, but your judgment could be slightly impaired."
pisces,20210331,"You need a push to make up your mind today. Otherise, you're just dithering. It's a good time to get advice from a dear friend or close family member, and your energy lifts your spirits."
pisces,20210401,"Someone in power is pulling rank today, which could drive you absolutely crazy. It's a good time for you to stay quiet and focus on your own projects, but you might have to give in to orders."
pisces,20210402,"Your righteous anger is giving way to something that feels like a win. It might take much of the day for you to sway those on the fence, but things should feel a lot better really soon."
pisces,20210403,"You play a supporting role in today's activities, so scout out the best scenes for your own action. You could find yourself bumped up to a starring role in the very near future if you get your lines right."
pisces,20210404,"Things just slide into place today. You're having an easy time of it, for sure! Anything that seems difficult is just needlessly complicated, so try to simplify and get to the core of what's real."

pisces,20210410,"You could feel utterly lost today, but sometimes that can be okay. If you feel trapped, try to get help. If not, just explore and see what you learn. This could be the start of something big!"
pisces,20210411,Try not to just give up and walk away when you're presented with your first puzzle today. There are more to come! You might want to try tackling issues with a freshly changed mind.
pisces,20210412,"Someone needs to hear from you today. If you don't know who it is, you need to keep reaching out until someone clicks. It should be clear once you get your reply."
pisces,20210413,"You feel good, which means you look good! Your energy is kind of low-key, but there's a power there that can't be denied. It's a great day for a first date or creative endeavor. Go for it!"
pisces,20210414,"You're seeing both sides of every argument today, and that makes it hard to take sides! You might have to do just that at some point if you want to avoid a long-term hassle. Flip a coin if you must!"
pisces,20210415,"Change is in the air, but it could be quick and sudden, not the slow, gradual morphing you prefer. Still, you can adapt, so keep your eyes open and see where the trends are heading."
pisces,20210416,"You feel not quite up to the task today, but you still have to give it your best shot. Things are just about to get a lot better, and you can make up for whatever goes down today."

pisces,20210419,"Though it might be difficult, try your best to deal with the tasks on your to-do list. Ignore interruptions as best you can. If your mind wanders too far, you could be out of luck."
pisces,20210420,"Your dreams may be more appealing than reality, but you've got to keep them in balance. Let yourself drift for a bit, but come back to business as often as you can. You can do it!"
pisces,20210421,It's a great day for solving problems and addressing major issues in your life. It might be time for you to step up and tell that one friend or relative what's really happening to you or to them.
pisces,20210422,Your closest relationships are all coming together now. It's related to your own spiritual and emotional energy. Enjoy the confluence!
pisces,20210423,"You've taken care of all your pressing business, so now should be a great time to rack up bonus karma by reaching out to help others. That could mean volunteering for the less fortunate."
pisces,20210424,"Today has a good balance of friends, family, and other matters. You may find that you're quite relaxed when the day draws to a close, so enjoy your rest when it finally comes."
pisces,20210425,"Someone close freaks out, which could cause you to freak out yourself. The closer they are, the weirder it gets, but the good news is that you're sure to find common ground before long."
pisces,20210426,Today you find yourself clearing out the old to make room for the new. This head start can give you the leverage you need to take the world by storm!
pisces,20210427,"Your ability to cope today is directly proportional to your self-confidence. As long as you feel up to the challenge, you can swim with the sharks, but once you start to doubt yourself, you may get chomped."
pisces,20210428,"Things are in turmoil, emotionally speaking, at least. You know that it's all for the best, but that doesn't mean that it feels any better to go through this. At least it should be over soon!"
pisces,20210429,"Exercise what authority you have to get your way today. It might take you some time, but that's okay. In fact, you should find that your energy is best spent on organizing others to work together."
pisces,20210430,"Keep your eyes open today. You've got to make sure that you're dealing with people as they really are and not as you wish they were. As long as you're thinking it all through, you should be fine."
pisces,20210501,"You can see the big picture a little bit better than other people today, so see if you can shift the group ever so slightly toward your vision. It doesn't take a lot of work!"
pisces,20210502,A mysterious benefactor helps your job search or some other quest in a big way. Don't spend too much time worrying about their identity. It should be clear soon enough.
pisces,20210503,"Try to relax a bit today. You deserve a break! It's a good time to skip out of work or school, if that doesn't get you in trouble. Enjoy what you've got and get back into the world tomorrow."
pisces,20210504,"You need to deal with your big plans for the future even if that means dreaming up new big plans. Your energy is just charging up, but by this time tomorrow, you should feel terrific!"
pisces,20210505,"Try out some new stuff today. It could be almost anything, but you may find it easier to indulge in a long-delayed plan or idea. You should be able to make some serious progress!"
pisces,20210506,"This is the day to really make changes. You never know what is going to happen until you try! Things should feel a lot more interesting by the end of the day, and your great energy helps a lot."
pisces,20210507,Try to just hunker down today. It's going to be hard for you to understand much of what's going on simply because your energy has been depleted pretty quickly. You should recharge soon!
pisces,20210508,"Something hidden from view turns out to be quite important, though you're the only one who can see what it is. Take your time in describing it to others, because they might not quite get it the first time."
pisces,20210509,"Enjoy the finer things in life, and make them yourself, if possible! Cooking is perfect, but you could also be crafting or doing almost anything that leads to a sweeter experience."
pisces,20210510,"You are softening with regard to a colleague or friend who has been misbehaving lately. In fact, they might apologize or even change quickly. Make sure that forgiveness is an option."
pisces,20210511,"You're feeling a bit more arty today, so communicate through poetry or other means. You should connect with the right people and confuse the wrong ones, so it's a win/win!"
pisces,20210512,"Try not to worry too much about the little details. Someone else is sure to figure them out. Focus instead on the broad view, because nobody but you can get a wide enough perspective."
pisces,20210513,"While you may not be in your element, exactly, you do feel a surge of creative energy flowing through you. Make the most of it and find some positive aspect of the day to make even better."
pisces,20210514,"You need to indulge your creative side a bit, so write out that business e-mail as a haiku, make your shopping list a work of art, or otherwise mix the mundane and the artistic. Make a habit of it!"
pisces,20210515,"Your emotional side is dominant and your energy is terrific, so this should be a pretty great day for you! If anything goes wrong, you are likely to let it slide over you pretty quickly."
pisces,20210516,"Try not to hold back your feelings, though that might be impossible anyway! You need to deal with someone who's close but may feel insecure about you, which means it's time for a heart-to-heart talk."
pisces,20210517,The people you work with every day are causing more trouble than they're worth for the time being. See if you can go it alone at least for one day.
pisces,20210518,This isn't a good time to get caught up in other people's drama. You might find it easier to sidestep the issue entirely than to just stick a toe in and hope you can pull it out when things get dangerous.
pisces,20210519,"You could find that life is extra confusing today, but it doesn't really matter! Relax in the knowledge that you are sure to figure it all out later. Things are just fine, really."
pisces,20210520,"It's all too easy to project your feelings onto other people today, so try your best not to assume too much about why people do whatever they do. If anything, you may want to ask them directly."
pisces,20210521,You're not really sure what's going on in part because the right person hasn't entered the picture yet. It's a really good time for you to check in with everyone important and see what still needs to happen.
pisces,20210522,"You're thinking about your connections today, and you should be able to get right with a friend or family member you've had trouble with lately without ever having a difficult discussion!"
pisces,20210523,"Forgive and forget! It's time for you to let someone off the hook, possibly for a debt but maybe for something much more intense. Your energy is perfect for letting go and moving on."
pisces,20210524,"Your senses are a little dimmer and fuzzier than usual, but it's not a bad sign! It actually means that your energy is turning within for a bit, so meditate or do what it takes to gain insight."
pisces,20210525,"Try not to get too deeply involved with your people's projects unless they pass a gut check. Your instincts are stronger than ever today, so try to get folks to listen to your advice."
pisces,20210526,"Your supervisor or teacher doesn't seem to listen today, so you might be better off keeping your opinions to yourself. This is short-lived, so take notes and get them at a better time."
pisces,20210527,"Try to avoid blunt communication today. If you can give yourself time to craft your message, you should be fine. That could be hard in the heat of the moment, so you're better off retreating for now."
pisces,20210528,Your colleagues are surprisingly helpful today even if you're not working or haven't worked in a while. You may get a new lead or just a little boost exactly when you need it. Enjoy!
pisces,20210529,"You're part of a bigger system, and you should find that everyone that's part of it has something to add today. It's a good idea to ask for help but also offer it whenever you can."
pisces,20210530,"Even if your plans are unrealistic, that doesn't mean that you should walk away from them. If anything, you should try to get your people to follow along despite their skepticism."
pisces,20210531,"Listen carefully when people talk about change today, though you might be reluctant to agree with them at first. The more you hear, the more intrigued you become. Soon, you're leading the way!"
pisces,20210601,"Try to find someone who needs your help today. It shouldn't be hard! Your energy is terrific, but it needs to focus outward if you want to make the most of it. The karma is nice too."
pisces,20210602,"Your innermost self is closer to the surface today, so make sure that you're paying attention! You could be surprised by what's been going on down there, but it's all positive."
pisces,20210603,"Something seemingly insignificant grows all out of proportion and takes over your life today, but this may be for the best! Sometimes you need to let yourself get absorbed fully into something new."
pisces,20210604,"You may find that your situation isn't black and white. It's either gray or rainbow striped! The ambiguity is fine with you, but a close friend or family member could have some problems with it."
pisces,20210605,"Try to speak up to the right people today. You may find that the words come to you more easily. Things may start to spin out of balance, but as long as you're at the center, all will be well."
pisces,20210606,"Your appearance is more important today, and your energy helps glam you up in some new way! It's a good time to attract romantic attention or ask for favors from those in power."
pisces,20210607,"Your love life needs a boost, and one comes along at just the right time! It's a good day to look into what it might take to either get a date with that hottie if you're single or sneak away with your partner if you're in a relationship."
pisces,20210608,"You feel totally overwhelmed today, though there's good news buried in the stress. Crises like these almost always lead to opportunities, so try to look to the future if possible."
pisces,20210609,"This is not a good time for change, but you may still have to deal with something big. You have to draw on allies and family in order to cope, but that ends up strengthening you in the end."
pisces,20210610,Your love life is shining today! You may find that your energy is perfect for dating or that your partner is perfectly in tune with your mindset. Things are definitely looking up!
pisces,20210611,Have fun with your chores and responsibilities today. It's easier than you may realize to make serious progress without even a single grumble. Whistle while you work and the fun comes soon enough.
pisces,20210612,"Your mind is flooded with creative ideas almost as soon as you wake up today, so write them down if you want to keep them handy. Your energy is terrific, and you can get to work on them later."
pisces,20210613,"It's a really good time for you to focus on your health. You may find that your physical and mental energies are tightly linked, and that could give rise to some new lifestyle choices."
pisces,20210614,"It's not a great day for you to focus attention on your own plans and needs. It might be hard for you to keep from blabbing about your recent progress, but that can wait for a better time."
pisces,20210615,"Your relationships are making life so much easier for you. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it! Things are looking up in general, but it's the social realm that drives your progress."
pisces,20210616,"Your help is needed elsewhere, so if you don't know where to go, reach out to your people and see who's got it the worst. Your energy demands an outward focus, so keep it flowing."
pisces,20210617,"You're being too hard on yourself again. It's time to let yourself off the hook, relax, and try to look to the future. Your ability to cope should be greatly improved as a result."
pisces,20210618,"Partnerships are tough today, so make sure that you're paying close attention to what your work buddy or sweetheart is doing. Nothing too hard should pop up, but you've got to handle it all quickly."
pisces,20210619,"It's time to clean house, metaphorically, anyway. Get rid of any negative emotional baggage however you can, and try to make room for more positive energy. It's easy for today."
pisces,20210620,"You are feeling a bit lackadaisical, especially when it comes to standing up for yourself! Try to avoid situations in which people think they can exploit you. They may be right!"
pisces,20210621,"You're a bit out of sorts today, though your energy should put you in a generally good mood. Avoid any big decisions if you can, and try to maintain a steady course through the day."
pisces,20210622,"You are feeling that you're in a bit over your head, but it's all illusory. Even that major threat that seems to be coming your way is nothing more than a creation of your inner doubts."
pisces,20210623,"Things are looking up for you as long as you don't back down! Today may bring a few fights your way, but as long as you can stand your ground for a day or two, life should get better soon."
pisces,20210624,"Exercise your authority early so you don't have to deal with conflict or chaos later. Things should start to ease up soon, but if you're not at least a little uncomfortable, you're taking a risk."
pisces,20210625,You've got people who can help you today no matter what problem you face. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance even if things look pretty terrible. You may stumble onto something great!
pisces,20210626,"Things are going your way today even if you feel a bit troubled by your latest setback. That's less significant than you may think, so don't worry too much about it. Face forward as much as you can!"
pisces,20210627,"Your desire to make people's lives better is front and center today, but don't forget your own life! It might be time for you to consider volunteering for yourself a few hours a week."
pisces,20210628,"A dream carries a significant message your way, so make sure that you're paying attention as soon as you wake up. Even the tiniest fragment of memory could mean quite a lot to you."
pisces,20210629,"Take good care of yourself today. You deserve it! Make it a spa day, splurge on something extravagant, or just cheat on your diet a little. You need a break every now and then!"
pisces,20210630,"It's a good social day, so check in with your people and see if there's anything going on that sounds fun. Almost anything's perfect for the way you're feeling now."
pisces,20210701,"A cloud is casting a long shadow over your world today, maybe literally, but certainly metaphorically. You need to make sure that you're not taking this all too seriously, because that prolongs the darkness."
pisces,20210702,"Something is fake. Can you tell what it is? You may find that your energy is best spent poring over everything of meaning to you in order to see what it is. It's boring, but it gets results!"
pisces,20210703,Your ability to express yourself is enhanced today -- especially in the romantic sphere. You should find that people are more easily swayed in all areas of life. Be as clear as you can!
pisces,20210704,"You've got the soul of an artist even if that's not how you make your living -- or even how you see yourself. Now is a good time to see the world with fresh eyes, to get a new perspective."
pisces,20210705,Poetry might work better for you than straightforward narrative -- so either dive into your favorite author or find a way to express yourself without being direct. Have fun with it!
pisces,20210706,"Try not to let yourself get nailed down today -- details are hard to deal with, and you don't want to be committed to something that you can't back up. Procrastinate as much as you can!"
pisces,20210707,"You're filled with creative energy today, and that could mean that you're ready for a new challenge. It could just as easily mean that you want to retreat and play with your art supplies. You make the call!"
pisces,20210708,"You are dreaming big dreams today -- so it's the perfect time for a life change! If you know what you want, go for it. If not, consult your intuition and go with your gut. It's hard to go wrong."
pisces,20210709,"Your performance is amazing today -- and that could mean almost anything, so go nuts! You should find that your energy is just right for showing others what you are capable of."
pisces,20210710,"Your coworkers may cause you more grief than they seem to be worth. That doesn't mean it's time to rage-quit your job or to look for a new career path, but you should ask some deep questions."
pisces,20210711,"Office politics are so vicious because the stakes are so small -- so don't get involved! If you can rise above the fray or sink beneath notice, you are the only one who comes out looking good."
pisces,20210712,"A supervisor or teacher throws a fit over something that seems laughably small to you. That doesn't mean you're in the right, but you should be able to see things clearly enough to adjust."
pisces,20210713,"Just push yourself today -- even if you're low-energy or in a bad mood, you can still get quite a lot done. Don't worry about what remains to be done or how much you don't know yet."
pisces,20210714,"This is not a good day for research or trying to figure out what's really going on -- if anything, you may find it harder than usual to understand basic information. That passes quickly!"
pisces,20210715,"You've done a lot for people, and today brings that into mind quite strongly. Try not to get too resentful if it seems they're not as appreciative as they could be -- that comes in its own time."
pisces,20210716,"It's time for you to settle a debt -- or at least get started on it. You may have been putting this off for a better time, but there's actually no time like the present for this kind of thing."
pisces,20210717,"It's a good day for finalizing agreements and settling on terms -- your ability to deal with details confidently is greatly enhanced. You still need to give it your complete concentration, though."
pisces,20210718,You're a little fuzzy-headed today -- but knowing that should help you get through the day with flair. You can count on people understanding you better as long as you keep an open heart.
pisces,20210719,"You need to make sure that you're dealing with people on their own terms -- but not if you feel uncertain of your own standing. In that case, back away until clarity returns."
pisces,20210720,"Try not to read too much into it, but you're riding a streak of luck through the day. Little things tend to go your way, and while there shouldn't be any big wins, there shouldn't be any losses either."
pisces,20210721,"A work-related problem doesn't go away today, try as you might to get rid of it. Things should start to settle down tomorrow, but for now, you've got to deal with it as directly as you can."
pisces,20210722,"You need to deal with a leadership vacuum today -- it could be anywhere. You may not feel totally comfortable stepping into power yourself, but the odds are good that it's the best answer."
pisces,20210723,You can see that a group you're part of is going in a bad direction -- but can you articulate the reason why? Now is the time to think it all through and then speak from the heart. You can do it!
pisces,20210724,Your head is swimming with new thoughts and ideas -- try not to get lost in the swirl! You may need to go for a run or find some other way to keep your body busy while your brain sorts itself out.
pisces,20210725,"This is not the most productive day of the month for you, but you should be able to make up for it if you're not already ahead of the game. You may want to wander off early or otherwise take a long break."
pisces,20210726,"Your energy is perfect for trying out new things. Even if they don't work out, you need the mental stimulation of experimentation, so grab an idea and run with it as far as you can!"
pisces,20210727,"Today is all about transformation -- and any changes you make are likely to be quite positive! Things aren't set in stone, and you may find that your energy can realign the situation to your liking."
pisces,20210728,You stumble over a delusion that has been holding you back -- which means you are just about free to move forward at a terrific pace! It's the perfect time to shake your head clear of all illusions.
pisces,20210729,"A dream is haunting you in a good way. You may have one image or a message that came from last night's sleep -- in any case, today's activities are colored by your subconscious."
pisces,20210730,"You have got to step up your game when it comes to communication. Things are getting weird for you, but the good news is that if you make yourself heard as clearly as you can, all will be well."
pisces,20210731,"You look good and you feel good -- it's a great combination! If you're looking for romance, now is the time to strut your stuff. If you're happy with your sweetie, let them know right away."
pisces,20210801,"It's a good time for pairings -- romantically and otherwise! You should be able to get along nicely with almost anyone you meet, and it's a good bet that you can work wonders together."
pisces,20210802,"Events may overwhelm you early today -- so try to get some down time if you can. It may take a while to recenter your emotional side, but you should find a way to get there if you make the effort."
pisces,20210803,"This is a great day to embrace the status quo -- even if you're usually against it. Sometimes big changes are more trouble than they're worth, and that is true for you today for sure."
pisces,20210804,"Your sweet, romantic side is dominant today. Show your sweetie what they mean to you or ask out that cutie you've been crushing on for weeks or longer. Your energy means you can't fail!"
pisces,20210805,"Take time out for fun today! Your personal energy is quite positive, and you should be able to make a game out of almost anything if you feel like it. Things are getting better and better for you!"
pisces,20210806,"Your health is making life weird today -- though there may not be anything you can put your finger on. Try to get a check-up or, better, take a positive step toward better living."
pisces,20210807,"Your opinions are important, of course, but you need to either keep them to yourself or go very easy on others today. You may find that people see you as more aggressive than you really are."
pisces,20210808,"You have got to mind your own business today, no matter what other people are saying within earshot. Any conflict you get involved in is likely to spin out of control pretty quickly."
pisces,20210809,"You need to deal with someone in a new relationship -- maybe with you, maybe with a sweetie, or maybe with a new employer. They aren't giving you what they need, so gently remind them you exist."
pisces,20210810,"You're in a good position to help your people today -- so make sure that you're giving them your all! When you send your energy out into the world, it comes back ten times over."
pisces,20210811,"Problems arise -- but only within your social life. It may be that a good friend or family member suddenly turns on you in some weird way, but the good news is that others take your side."
pisces,20210812,"You've had a hard time letting go of some old feelings -- until today, anyway! Somehow you feel free to liberate yourself from your old baggage. Send it off in style and enjoy the sense of relief."
pisces,20210813,"It's time to go for something new and better -- so make sure that you're on the lookout for ways to improve your lot in life. Opportunities are coming your way, so get ready for them!"
pisces,20210814,"You may feel like a doormat -- but others see you as a saint! Your energy is actually better than you think it is, and you can offer more to the outside word while still retaining your dignity."
pisces,20210815,Just because you can't make up your mind about something doesn't mean that you're wishy-washy. Sometimes you're just waiting for a sign -- or the right information -- to come your way.
pisces,20210816,"You are up in arms over some seeming slight -- but you can take advantage of this by turning it into an opportunity. See if you can change the world for the better because of it. Righteousness has a place in the world too, so make the most of it!"
pisces,20210817,"You need to lay down the law at home or at work -- someone is breaking the rules in a way that is causing real problems. This may not be a comfortable situation, but you can make it better."
pisces,20210818,You've got friends looking out for you -- even when you don't know they're around. You may find a door opening thanks to hidden manipulations; run through it with abandon and don't worry about how it happened!
pisces,20210819,A coworker lends a hand today -- even if it's their day off or you are actually on the hunt for a new gig. Something they say or do leads the way to something that is much better for both of you.
pisces,20210820,"Your desire to serve the world is dominant today, so get out there and volunteer or do good deeds on your own. The energy you project is sure to come back to you enhanced tenfold."
pisces,20210821,"A dream bears an important message for you, so make sure that you're taking your unconscious life as seriously as anything else. Even if you can't recall every detail, you should still understand."
pisces,20210822,"Your ability to connect with others is greatly enhanced today, so make the most of it by reaching out to someone new. You may find it easier than ever to deal with a certain family member."
pisces,20210823,Try not to get too bent out of shape over today's revelation -- if anything you should be grateful for what you're hearing! Your terrific personal energy helps you turn this into a moment of growth.
pisces,20210824,"Your help is in great demand today, so make sure that you're free with it. Your energy is at its best when used in the service of others, and you can get some serious satisfaction out of your efforts."
pisces,20210825,You are feeling utterly absorbed by something new and wonderful -- though your energy is somewhat diffuse. It's one of those days when you should just focus on the positive at all costs.
pisces,20210826,"Ambiguity is the answer today. When someone tries to nail you down, just smile and let them think whatever they want to think. You can burst their bubble some other day, and things should go fine."
pisces,20210827,"An illusion that you've believed for ages dissolves into vapor today -- and your life is much richer for it! The disappointment shouldn't last long, as you're too excited about what's real."
pisces,20210828,"Someone says something really nice -- and catches you off guard in a delightful way! It may be a curmudgeon at work or a mean ex, but the sweetness is simply impossible to deny."
pisces,20210829,You feel busier today -- even if your schedule is exactly the same as it was yesterday. It may be that your mental energy is taken up with other concerns so normal chores feel more overwhelming.
pisces,20210830,"Duality isn't usually a problem for you -- it's not too hard for you to absorb contradictions. Today, though, you need to make sure that you're able to make hard choices quickly."
pisces,20210831,"Your emotions are almost overwhelmingly positive today -- your love life is where it needs to be, and your friends are getting everything they need from you. It's a great day!"
pisces,20210901,"Your sweetheart is making life even better -- or if you're single, you may get a new interest in someone you know is compatible. Move forward and enjoy the love buzz that blossoms!"
pisces,20210902,A bright idea pops up in your head today that keeps you focused on the positive aspects of your life. Keep following it up until you can see where it leads. This is the start of something really big!
pisces,20210903,Your boss or teacher may be in a foul mood -- or there could be another reason that they're saying no to your latest plan. There's not much to be done but get back to the drawing board.
pisces,20210904,"You need to do whatever you can to keep your mind focused today -- even if that means shutting the door and even being rude to family or colleagues. It's just for today, so don't worry too much about it."
pisces,20210905,"Do you know what's really going on? If so, you're a rarity. You need to reconsider the roles people are playing in your life, because at least one of them needs a major shift in order to work out right."
pisces,20210906,Your closest relationships are making life a lot more interesting today. See if you can push a little in order to get your people to open themselves up to more positive options. Things can get better!
pisces,20210907,"Someone needs your help in a big way. See if you can get them to open up, but if they refuse, you just have to guess and do your best. Even if they don't appreciate it, you still feel that obligation."
pisces,20210908,"You're facing a big choice today. It may be as obvious as an actual forking path or it may be somewhat subtler, but you know that you can't make it past this point without a commitment of some kind."
pisces,20210909,"Balance is everything today. You've got to find a way to keep every part of your life stable and nurtured while still moving forward at the same pace. It's a challenge, but you can do it!"
pisces,20210910,You don't feel quite right today -- and those around you aren't helping! The weird thing is that your energy is actually quite strong. You just can't seem to apply it to your own life!
pisces,20210911,Try not to force any decisions today -- you've got to deal with the complex situations as they stand and put off anything major for another day or so. Things start to make more sense soon.
pisces,20210912,"Your mouth may get you in trouble today -- secrets just aren't safe with you! It may be a good idea to lie low if you're holding on to something especially juicy, just to ensure it stays quiet for another day."
pisces,20210913,"It's hard to convince folks you're right today -- especially those more senior than you. Try not to worry too much about their opinions, as circumstances should eventually prove you right."
pisces,20210914,"Your colleagues are making life much simpler today -- even if you're not at work or out of work entirely! Someone connects you to your next big thing, though it may not look like much today."
pisces,20210915,"Your assistance is required for something big and important. It's likely work-related, but it may come from any corner of your life -- so pay attention! Jump in when you see the chance."
pisces,20210916,"You feel enthused about a plan that others consider unrealistic. Now is not the time to convince them -- in fact, you should just get to work on it and let your results speak for themselves."
pisces,20210917,"Change is good! You know that in your bones, but sometimes parts of your brain conspire to make you doubt yourself. It's a good time to force yourself into the next big thing."
pisces,20210918,"Your deep need to help people is out on display today -- so much so that you may be pursued by those who think they need you most of all! It's not the worst position to be in, but you may have to say 'no.'"
pisces,20210919,"Other people are making life better -- so surround yourself with friends, family and anyone else who feels right. Your amazing personal energy ensures that they stick close by."
pisces,20210920,"Personal issues dominate the day -- but with energy this positive, you find it easy to handle anything that could be a problem. Most likely you end up significantly better off than when you got up this morning."
pisces,20210921,Something that seems totally real is actually illusory -- but you may not figure that out until a few days have passed. Your best bet is to assume that something's not quite right.
pisces,20210922,"You feel trapped in a maze of twisty passages -- but it's all just a matter of perspective. Once you've wandered for a while, you are sure to find a secret exit that only occurs to those who feel lost."
pisces,20210923,"Poetry is the best way to communicate today -- even with those who claim to hate it. Go easy on them, but make sure that you're speaking and writing from the heart, not the head."
pisces,20210924,"Communication is everything today -- so even if you're not feeling up to it, make sure that you're pushing all the right buttons and checking in with folks you haven't heard from in a while."
pisces,20210925,"You feel the change before it comes -- which means it's easier for you to adapt. Try to help your friends or colleagues do the same, but don't be too surprised if they are much more resistant."
pisces,20210926,Could you feel more overwhelmed? Don't ask -- but there is a silver lining. You are almost sure to ask for support and guaranteed to get it when you do. Fall back on friends or family.
pisces,20210927,"This is not the best day for moving or changing, so make sure that you're staying put as much as possible. Things are looking a lot better in the near future if you can just zoom through today."
pisces,20210928,"Your emotional energy is on the upswing, and you can have fun doing almost anything. It's a good time for you to take a second look at your work or home chores and see how you can do them better."
pisces,20210929,"Love and romance are on your mind today -- maybe thanks to a new crush, or maybe you're just reminded why you fell for your sweetheart in the first place. It's a great day to spend on love."
pisces,20210930,"You're dealing with a new reality today -- one that you should find quite appealing! Make sure you're not just seeing what you want to see, then set about making this work for you."
pisces,20211001,"This is the perfect day to take better care of your health. It may be time for you to just see a doctor, or it could be that you know exactly what needs to change to impact your life for the better."
pisces,20211002,"Your opinions are bubbling up from out of nowhere -- but that just means that you need to take better care of them, not just release them into the wild! Slow down before getting into arguments."
pisces,20211003,Ask yourself big questions today -- but don't expect clear answers to come right away. You especially need to figure out if you are dealing with the right people to solve your problems.
pisces,20211004,"A close relationship needs some work -- but you are in the right place to do whatever is necessary. You may have to convince the other party that they need to pull their weight, though!"
pisces,20211005,"It's a good time to find a balance between your work and home lives -- or any other two aspects of your life that seem to be opposed to each other. It's easier than you think, so get busy!"
pisces,20211006,Things are starting to get weird between you and a romantic or business partner -- or anyone else who's close enough to know your quirks. Just take a deep breath and talk it all out.
pisces,20211007,"It's time to clean house! That could mean you actually spend the day clearing out the attic, or it could be a spiritual challenge. Get rid of old clutter and make room for new, better stuff."
pisces,20211008,"This is not the best time to tackle new projects -- especially those you're not sure of in the first place. Things need to settle down somewhat, and you've got plenty to take on already."
pisces,20211009,You may know what you want -- but that doesn't mean that anyone else is paying attention. It's better to do your own thing than keep helping others in the hopes that they'll eventually help you in return.
pisces,20211010,"Someone thinks they know better than you -- and unfortunately, they are almost certainly in a position to do something about it. Expect to be overridden; what comes next is up to you."
pisces,20211011,"Sometimes you know exactly what you want -- or exactly what should happen. Today brings a righteous energy that helps you discern truth from lies, so use it wisely. The future is riding on it!"
pisces,20211012,"Your friends or colleagues are moving in the wrong direction -- and you're the only one who can see catastrophe looming! It's hard to warn others of what they can't see, but you should still succeed."
pisces,20211013,"You've got a favor coming your way -- from someone you didn't even realize owed you anything! It's one of those days when you've made your own luck, so enjoy the benefits and move on."
pisces,20211014,"Change is coming, like it or not. The weird thing is it feels really sudden, but if you just let it wash over you, you should quickly realize that it's been coming for weeks or even years."
pisces,20211015,"You need to direct all this energy outward -- you can tell that a surge is coming, and you need to spend some of it down so you don't overload! At least one good friend needs a lift anyway."
pisces,20211016,You are feeling terrific -- but you can also tell that you've got a narrow window of opportunity for some major self-improvement. Try not to put off anything that feels positive.
pisces,20211017,Focus on the needs of others today -- they are energizing you and leading you to be your best self. It's a great time for you to show the universe what you are capable of. Expect greatness!
pisces,20211018,A veil has come between you and a friend -- but the good news is that you both need some downtime anyway! It's a great day to think about all you don't know and formulate one big question.
pisces,20211019,"You feel totally absorbed by some new event or discovery -- so go with it! You may find that someone else is paying attention, so invite them to join you and see where your journey takes you both."
pisces,20211020,You see the world with a poet's eyes today -- so try to capture some of that sentiment as you wander through the world. It's much easier for you to communicate emotions to others.
pisces,20211021,"It's time for you to edge out of your comfort zone and confront someone who's getting away with murder. Communication comes more easily, so this should go better than you expect."
pisces,20211022,"You're a thing of beauty today! It's a great time to get romantic attention, but you could also just enjoy the company of friends or even get noticed by headhunters. See and be seen!"
pisces,20211023,"Everything is in flux today -- but that's okay with you. Even if you can't keep up with the pace of change, you should still be able to make little adjustments that make life easier for everyone involved."
pisces,20211024,"You may feel totally overwhelmed by early today -- but the good news is that feeling can't last forever! In fact, you should start to see some relief long before sundown. Try to relax!"
pisces,20211025,"Your sweet side is out in force today -- so show your partner how you really feel or ask out that super-cutie you just met. Even if things don't go precisely your way, you are sure to get a boost!"
pisces,20211026,You are having too much fun today -- things just seem to keep getting better! It's a great time to throw an impromptu party or to find new people to make friends with. Enjoy the great energy!
pisces,20211027,Can you keep your nose out of other people's business -- even when you're desperately curious? It's a good time for you to just slow down and let others do whatever they're going to do anyway.
pisces,20211028,"There's just way too much going on for you to be able to handle it all. Try to delegate some of this activity to others who are idling, but expect a certain amount of backlog to catch up with later."
pisces,20211029,"You've got to mind your own business today -- even if curiosity is killing you! At least one colleague just needs their privacy, so let them stew or freak out until tomorrow at the earliest."
pisces,20211030,"People may see you as a spooky poet, but your left brain works just fine. On a day like today, you can use the power of logic to get past almost any problem. Surprise someone with your analysis."
pisces,20211031,You really don't have to know everything in order to make plans or take action today -- so ignore your ignorance and move forward full steam ahead! You are sure to understand how it all works later.
pisces,20211101,"Your assistance is essential today, so make sure that you're looking around for opportunities to help. Karmic debts get repaid with interest as you go about your day, so enjoy the ride."
pisces,20211102,How is your cash flow? Now is the time to really think about your relationship with money. It might be somewhat easier for you to deal with things like budgets and investments.
pisces,20211103,"Is debt an issue for you? If so, today is perfect for climbing out from under it. If not, then it may be a metaphor for repaying someone who once helped you out in some deep way. Get on it!"
pisces,20211104,"Emotions are boiling over today, but you can see that it's all for the best. Things are looking up for you and your people, and this outlet is clearing the path for better things to come."
pisces,20211105,"Work might feel a bit more difficult than usual, but it's only because you'd rather be doing something else. Your great energy can't be tamed, so see if you can sneak away and do your own thing."
pisces,20211106,"You've got to stay clear on the big new issue in your life. And while your energy is far from its peak, you can still see things for what they are. It's better to watch and wait than to act hastily."
pisces,20211107,"You may not know what the right thing to do is, but you know that you've got to do it! Draw on your inner resources and you should be able to figure it out before it's too late."
pisces,20211108,"Life gets a little easier for you today, and you may find that little things all start to go your way. Enjoy the ride, but try not to read too much into it. Things should return to normal soon."
pisces,20211109,"You need to help your people find someone who can give them direction. It might actually be you! If not, your eye for talent should lead you in the right direction pretty quickly."
pisces,20211110,"You shouldn't try to go it alone today. Things are too complicated for that. Teamwork is easier to deal with than usual, even if your people are recalcitrant or tied up with internal conflict."
pisces,20211111,A flash of wisdom comes to you early in the day. This could mean almost anything from a new take on your job search to a new willingness to give up an old bad habit. Make the most of it!
pisces,20211112,Take care of your own needs today even if others seem like helpless little kittens! Sometimes the best thing you can do is to let others figure out how to take care of themselves.
pisces,20211113,"You need to treat yourself right today, if only so that others can learn from your example. Try not to get too crazy, but with energy this good, it's okay to indulge a bit more than usual."
pisces,20211114,"You are hidden behind layers of camouflage today, which is perfect! You might not feel quite right about deceiving others, but it's for the best, and it shouldn't have to last for much longer."
pisces,20211115,"Someone is trying to deceive you today. That could be a bad thing, but if you recognize them for what they really are, you can turn the tables with ease. Skepticism rules the day."
pisces,20211116,"Romance is in the air today, so get out there and indulge! Wink at someone cute or buy flowers for your sweetie. Do whatever it takes to ride this wave and enjoy what you've got!"
pisces,20211117,You finally get beyond that illusory feeling of anxiety or despair and see it for what it really is: another obstacle. It's easy to move beyond it and see what comes next!
pisces,20211118,"Your communication skills are legendary today, thanks to an infusion of great energy that guides your brain as you form words. Make the most of it and show others how it's done!"
pisces,20211119,"Something you were convinced was a sure bet turns out to be all smoke and mirrors, but you're much better off knowing the truth! It might sting at first, but this is one of those moments that defines your life."
pisces,20211120,"You thought you knew what was what, but it turns out that clarity is hard to come by these days. The good news is that you're almost due for a moment of perfect lucidity. Embrace it when it comes!"
pisces,20211121,"You're working on something new today, and it could make a big difference in your life! It's a good time to redirect your energy and find new ways to live your life. You're at a turning point!"
pisces,20211122,"You're showing someone else how entertaining life can be, and they're definitely playing along! You could be discovering new ways of enjoying life or revisiting old ones. Either way, you win!"
pisces,20211123,"A performance of some kind plays an important part in today's activities. You may feel as if you're playing a role, but it's just as likely that you're a spectator. Things are really rolling now!"
pisces,20211124,"Can you keep up with today's speedy pace? It's hard to be certain, but you can at least prioritize and make sure that you handle all the day's most important business. Things should settle down tomorrow."
pisces,20211125,"Those around you are harder to deal with than usual, but where can you go? It's just one of those days when you need to accommodate people a little more than usual. You can endure."
pisces,20211126,"Today is all about quick action, so make sure that you're not hesitating. It's one of those days when you're sure that you're due for a change, and things should work out in your favor."
pisces,20211127,"This is not the time for heavy thought. You're better off taking action instead. You can piece together everything that went down some other time, and things should make more sense then."
pisces,20211128,"It's time for you to start on a new project. Your energy is just right for beginnings, and this could be work related, romantic, or almost anything else. You should know what will work out best for you."
pisces,20211129,"It's hard to deal with that one partner or close friend who's being unreasonable, but you have to keep trying anyway! Your persistence is sure to be rewarded, but it may take a few extra days."
