alone\\n\\'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion\\nLeft to find our way through a Hitchcock film\\nIn an empty bed with an hour to kill\\n\\'Cause it\\'s only fun on the edge of oblivion

a party\\nMy friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30\\nThis things at a frat house but the people are cool there\\nReluctant I followed but I never dreamed there\\nWould be someone there who would catch my attention\\nI wasn\\'t out searching for love or affection\\nSo I paid my 3 and the girls got in free\\nShine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band\\nSomeone in the background was doing a keg stand\\nThis place is so lame all these girls look the same\\nAll these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed\\nIn my bed back at home watching TV alone\\nWhere I\\'d put on some porn or have sex on the phone\\nFar from people I hate down from anywhere state\\nTrying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there\\nWith green eyes and long blond hair\\nShe wasn\\'t wearing underwear at least I prayed that\\nShe might be the one maybe we\\'d have some fun\\nMaybe we\\'d watch the sun rise\\nBut that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard to impress\\nWith the way that they dress\\nWith those things on their chests\\nAnd the things they suggest to me I couldn\\'t believe what this lady was saying\\nThe names she was dropping the games she was playing\\nShe dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly\\'s\\nHow she\\'s down with the Iwise well constructed disguise\\nNow I\\'d rather go dateless than stay here and hate this\\nHer volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless\\nSo I said I\\'d call her but never would bother\\nUntil I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there\\nWith green eyes and long blonde hair\\nShe won\\'t be wearing underwear and you\\'ll discover\\nThis girl\\'s not the one and she\\'ll never be fun\\nYou should just turn and run because you\\'ll find out that\\nSome girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard to impress\\nWith the way that they dress\\nWith those things on their chest\\nAnd the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard\\nSome girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream

I\\'ve been turning it over and over in my mind lately.\\nI\\'ve read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I\\'m through. I\\'ve been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I\\'ve wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.\\nI keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don\\'t look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.\\nI\\'ve never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I\\'m completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won\\'t be too much longer until I\\'m able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I\\'m sick of always hearing\\nAll the sad songs on the radio\\nAll day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy\\nThat he\\'s lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show\\nWe would stay up all through the night\\nWe would laugh and get high\\nAnd never answer the phone I can\\'t forgive\\nCan\\'t forget\\nCan\\'t give in what went wrong\\n\\'Cause you said this was right\\nYou fucked up my life I\\'m sick of always hearing\\nSappy love songs on the radio\\nThis place is fucking cursed in its plague\\nAnd I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can\\'t forgive\\nCan\\'t forget\\nCan\\'t give in what went wrong\\nCause you said this was right\\nYou fucked up my life I\\'m kicking out fiercely of the world around me\\nWhat went wrong I\\'m kicking Don\\'t wanna hear the static on the TV screen\\nDon\\'t wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?\\nWhere did I go wrong?\\nSometimes I just don\\'t know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days You\\'re not the only one who grew up feeling scared\\nYou\\'re not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone\\'s gone missing\\nEveryone\\'s done wrong\\nSometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days You\\'re giving up\\nWe\\'re getting out\\nWe were young and we\\'re not growing up\\nWe\\'re not growing up You\\'re giving up\\nWe\\'re getting out\\nWe were young and we\\'re not growing up\\nWe\\'re not growing up Save yourself where I was saving\\nWe\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days\\nWe\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em\\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\\nThese are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\\nThese are the good old days Last night it came as a picture\\nWith a good reason, a warning sign\\nThis place is void of all passion\\nIf you can imagine it\\'s easy if you try\\nBelieve me I failed this effort\\nI wrote a reminder this wasn\\'t a vision\\nThis time where are you Houston\\nIs somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you My head is made up of memories\\nMost of them useless delusions\\nThis room is bored of rehearsal\\nAnd sick of the boundaries\\nI miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nThis time I don\\'t want to\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI feel alone and tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you Should I go back

tired\\nShould I go back should I go back should I\\nI hope I won\\'t forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go\\nThey question who we used to be\\nSometimes I feel like I\\'m the oxygen between\\nThe cigarette and gasoline I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream\\nOf going back to San Diego\\nWe bought a one way ticket\\nSo we could go see the Cure\\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\\nAnd think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)\\nCan\\'t go back to San Diego (can\\'t go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)\\nLate at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)\\nAbandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors\\nI read the sadness on your face I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream\\nOf going

know\\nHow deep these cuts on you go\\nAnd like a river they flow\\nTo the ocean blue Going back to San Diego\\nWe bought a one way ticket\\nSo we could go see the Cure\\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\\nAnd think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)\\nCan\\'t go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can\\'t go back to San Diego) I got no regret right

pretend to restore what we have and hold on\\nAt times like these\\nIt\\'s obvious\\nI saw you again\\nI know you fucked him again\\nCan you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge\\nAre you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these\\nIt\\'s obvious\\nAt times like these\\nIt\\'s obvious I saw you again and again and again\\nThere\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on\\nAnd I saw you again and again and again\\nHow do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again\\nThere\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on\\nAnd I saw you

inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach\\nSomething inside is incomplete\\nI numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time\\nI promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home)\\nThe only time I feel

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]\\nThe tidal wave and aftermath\\nI\\'m seasick from the years we\\'ve passed\\nAdrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin\\nShe said goodbye and left again\\nThese empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time\\nI promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home)\\nThe only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for\\n(The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home)\\nThe only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for\\n(The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]\\nLife\\'s so strange\\nTime won\\'t change\\nThe world slips by, I\\'m afraid that she never gave much anyway\\nLife\\'s so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home)\\n(I\\'ll take the last train home)\\nThe only time I feel alive is when
